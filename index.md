# Indiana 50501 Website

Welcome. We are the **resistance**. Thank you for coming. We are Indiana 50501, an aggressive, **[non violent](/scott/essays/9_reasons_for_non_violence.html)** distributed protest organization that is dedicated to removing the **Trump Regime** from power.

We are organized at the State and Congressional District level and ultimately the town level. Our goal is to organize 288,000 people here in Indiana which is 3.5% of the population. That's the magic level where [Erica Chenoweth](https://www.ericachenoweth.com/research/wcrw) says authoritarian regimes fail.

## How We Organize

50501 grew up on the Internet and we make use of [Signal](https://signal.org/) and [Discord](https://discord.com/) for encrypted communications. 

The serious organizing happens on Signal where ideas show up, get analyzed and, if they are good and someone likes them, implemented. Implementation is often led by the person who had the idea, since they will tend to have the most drive to see it happen. 

As senior leadership, our role is to curate the community and support people in making the magic happens. We take the position that leader's exist to serve the community.

Oh and we also hang out and talk about gardening, arts and crafts, vent about the insane state of the world and whatever. 

We are a chaotic, anarchic, distributed group and **it works**.  We refer to it internally as a hive mind and, well, come in and see.

To get into our Signal, [click here](/joinsignal/). We actively ban trolls and MAGA. 

## How to Donate

We don't actually take money.  We take donations in kind.  The reason for this is covered in our [FAQ](faq.html).

Our [FAQ](faq.html) also talks about it although not everything is set up yet.  We do need an accounting type person to help us manage the process.

We believe in building a radically transparent organization based on a learning model that incorporates the good and the bad (aka post mortem documents).  That's means we need to listen to everyone, and so:

## Trackers of Badness

We are asked sometimes what we are so **mad** about; why are we **protesting**.  Here are some of the **fact** based resources that track the changes in America since Trump 2.0:

* [Disappeared People Tracker](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/danielleharlow/viz/UnitedStatesDisappearedTracker/Map)
* [LinkTree of Trackers of Badness](https://linktr.ee/fedcutstracker)
* [People Affected / Killed by DOGE due to funding cuts](https://theimpactproject.org/the-impact-map/)
* [Project 2025 Tracker](https://www.project2025.observer/)
* [ICE Contractors](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/1/viewer?mid=1KeW54O65sJbdwu30iXkVwyvmTU_bqIQ&ll=38.90591865798976%2C-93.37344314620407&z=3)

Let me repeat that first one a bit louder: **THERE IS NOW AN OFFICIAL WEB TOOL TO TRACK THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN AMERICA DISAPPEARED BY ICE**.  If you didn't either have a tear come to your eye or throw up a bit in your mouth then please re-read this sentence.

## The Nerd Stuff

If you got here then you are likely a tech person like me. Technologically I am an open source guy with a bias for Ruby and Python. My bona fides include founding NTERGAID, Feedster, co founding Covid Near me and Pizza For Ukraine, writing AppData and scaling it until acquired. 

We do need some IT help and I want you to email me with the subject line:

FELLOW NERD THAT VALUES SECURITY

Initial technical work is the DevOps work to push our content from GitHub where it is stored to our website which is a DreamHost box. Right now this is a local process that I want to push into a GitHub action.

Follow on work involves setting up an instance of EtherPad on an offshore Hetzner box for document collaboration. 

Peace fellow nerd. Thanks.
