# Indiana 50501 Website

Welcome. We are the **resistance**. Thank you for coming. We are Indiana 50501, an aggressive, **[non violent](/scott/essays/9_reasons_for_non_violence.html)** distributed protest organization that is dedicated to removing the **Trump Regime** from power.

We are organized at the State and Congressional District level (districts 7 and 8 have leadership) and ultimately the town level. Our goal is to organize 288,000 people here in Indiana which is 3.5% of the population. That's the magic level where [Erica Chenoweth](https://www.ericachenoweth.com/research/wcrw) says authoritarian regimes fail.

## How We Organize

50501 grew up on the Internet and we make use of [Signal](https://signal.org/) and [Discord](https://discord.com/) for encrypted communications. 

The serious organizing happens on Signal where ideas show up, get analyzed and, if they are good and someone likes them, implemented. Implementation is often led by the person who had the idea, since they will tend to have the most drive to see it happen. 

As senior leadership, our role is to curate the community and support people in making the magic happens. We take the position that leader's exist to serve the community.

Oh and we also hang out and talk about gardening, vent about the insane state of the world and whatever. 

We are a chaotic, anarchic, distributed group and **it works**.  We refer to it internally as a hive mind and, well, come in and see.

To get into our Signal, find someone in leadership or someone who has access and get them to invite you. We actively ban trolls and MAGA. 

## How to Donate

Watch our fund raising video on YouTube.  This will appear soon.  

Our [FAQ](faq.html) also talks about it although not everything is set up yet.  We do need an accounting type person to help us manage the process.  I know you're out there since you talked to me on Saturday but I didn't get your details.

## Governing Documents

Here are the start of our governing documents:

1. [Statement of Values](/docs/values.html)
2. [Roles and Responsibilities](/docs/roles_and_responsibilities.html)
3. [Indiana Organization Structure](/docs/org_structure.html)
4. [Audio Issue Analysis](/docs/audio_analysis.html)
5. Post Mortem for 3/15 Rally -- TBD
6. Post Mortem for 3/14 Rally -- TBD
7. [Post Mortem for 3/8 Rally](/docs/post_mortem_2025_03_08.html)
8. [Post Mortem for 3/4 Protest](/docs/post_mortem_2025_03_04.html)

We believe in building a radically transparent organization based on a learning model that incorporates the good and the bad (aka post mortem documents).  That's means we need to listen to everyone, and so:

## How to Tell Us We Are Wrong (or share ideas)

My name is Scott Johnson and I am the person in charge of 50501 in the state of Indiana. 

You have two ways to tell me I am wrong:

1. Find me at the Castleton Tesla Dealership, 8280 Castleton Corner Drive and come hold an Anti Tesla sign with me. I hold office hours there Monday to Saturday 11 to 1. I have *extra* signs. Come by.  Bring a snack.  Hang out now that the weather isn't terrible.  Please note that on rainy days I sometimes skip.  You can always text first to verify I am around.
2. Email me below. 


fuzzygroup at gmail.com

That's my personal email account that I have been using since Gmail existed. It is my only email account. 

Got something to tell us?  You know what to do ... *winces*

## The Nerd Stuff

If you got here then you are likely a tech person like me. Technologically I am an open source guy with a bias for Ruby and Python. My bona fides include founding NTERGAID, Feedster, co founding Covid Near me and Pizza For Ukraine, writing AppData and scaling it until acquired. 

We do need some IT help and I want you to email me with the subject line:

FELLOW NERD THAT VALUES SECURITY

Initial technical work is the DevOps work to push our content from GitHub where it is stored to our website which is a DreamHost box. 

Follow on work involves setting up an instance of EtherPad on an offshore Hetzner box for document collaboration. 

Peace fellow nerd. Thanks.
