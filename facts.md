# Facts 
 
This page is for **facts** about politics in Indiana.  This is **opposition research**.  We need to know who the enemy is, where they are and how we can take advantage of them.  This is a single web page that anyone on the web team (which can be anyone in Indiana 50501) can edit.  The idea here is one page where we can find things like Todd Rokita's address (should we want to protest there) or the names of Braun's 4 daughters should we want to make signs shaming him for disenfranchising his own daughters.
 
I expect this page to be disorganized and messy initially and then hone into something useful. Just simple string search (Command / Control + F) should be enough to make it useful.

This page is mostly owned by **Judy Wilson** who runs Indiana 50501 Opposition Research.
