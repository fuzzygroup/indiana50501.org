# Shred Project 2025

Here at Indiana 50501, we have been successful enough simply following the 50501 mantra that we are now ready to start offering our own "branded" protests and the first one of these will be **Shred Project 2025**.  The idea here is:

* Vary our normal format of Speaker / March / Speaker with something more dynamic
* Get between 10 and 12 speakers, each one focused on a different section of Project 2025
* Have the speakers talk about what's bad, how this hurts America
* At the end of each speech, feed the print out into a shredder

We currently have 1 speaker lined up for this, Sara from our community.

What we are looking for is someone who can:

* Understand Project 2025
* Find Speakers whether from our community or not
* Work with them to make sure their presentations are dynamic and on point
* Organize the effort
* Work with our film maker Ryan to make sure that videos are captured and put on YouTube and TikTok

There is also a prop aspect to this in that we want to do this while flanked by cardboard cut outs with the face of Vought and Miller who are the public face of Project 2025.  And then, at the end, we need to shred or burn or destroy these cut outs.

**Note**: This will be run as part of the 4/19 50501 Protest.  Rather than run separate protests for our branded efforts, we have opted to fold them into the main 50501 protest.
