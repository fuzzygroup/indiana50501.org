# Make Signal Vetting System Actually Work Well

Vetting is the process of confirming that someone who wants to be part of your community is who they say are rather than someone else.

Example: Let in a left leaning folk and keep out MAGA

## Problem: Signal Has no Vetting Tools

## Solution: The /joinsignal/ Url on Our Website

The way this works is that we vet people by putting them in a conversation with an Admin who can determine who they are.

Because we don't want this to land on ONLY one person, we can do the following:

1. Have a set of Signal user ids embedded in a JavaScript routine on the /joinsignal/ url
2. Have one of those user ids randomly selected and presented to user as "CHAT WITH AN ADMIN"

## Platforms:

This needs to work on:

* Mac OS
* At least some windows version
* IOS
* Android

## Issues
