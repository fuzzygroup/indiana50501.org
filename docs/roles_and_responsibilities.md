**Indiana 50501 Roles and Responsibilities**  
One of the issues that we are having is that are moving at Warp Speed and we are starting to step on each other's toes.  
The solution here is to break down roles and responsibilities so that we know who does what and who owns what.  
**Scott Roles and Responsibilities**

Scott's role is that of PIC (person in charge).  Scott's specific responsibilities are:

* Strategy  
* Technology  
* Writing (I suspect I'll cross wise report to Taelar for long form blogging)  
* MC  
* Chief bottle washer and juggler

**Taelar Roles and Responsibilities**

Taelar's role is two fold:

* Overall non Facebook Social Media Manager.  Facebook is not just social media; it is also an operational tool.  Taelar does not have a role in the Facebook side of things.  
  * Taelar is responsible for staffing up a social media team for posting on each of the many channels we want to utilize.  This will include (this also lists the social media account name):
