# Script for Working Spartz Rally

## Take 3: THE FINAL WORKING SCRIPT

1. (Walk up and have a postcard and whistle in hand ready to hand out).
2. Hi!  Can I bend your ear for a bit?
3. Have you ever heard of 50501?
4. If no:
\
We are a distributed protest group AGAINST the current administration.
\
We run the same protest in 50 states, 50 capitals at 1 time.
\
We are SHOCK and AWE for protesting.
\
We are trying to make America realize we have a real problem.
\
5. If yes:
\
Awesome.  Can I give you a postcard to our next event in Indianapolis and a safety whistle?
\
6. If get positive reaction:
\
Here is a postcard for our next event in Indianapolis and a safety whistle.
\
7. If they ask what about Muncie?
\
We are new and we are staffing up.  We want a muncie chapter.  Maybe you want to come to Indianapolis and talk to us about running one.
\
8. The reason for the whistle is that at events like this across the nation -- Idaho, Colorado, we have see people get dragged out when they ask questions angrily.  We think that's wrong.  If you see it happening, blow your whistle.
