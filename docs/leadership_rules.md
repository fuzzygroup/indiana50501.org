# Leadership Rules

1.  We stay composed in public.  We present a unified front.  We won't lose our minds in main chat.  De-escalate or move it to leadership chats.
2.  We will NEVER appoint anyone as a district or county leader without them:

* Going through training in Indianapolis at an event -or- one of 0ur leaders (in either leadership group) going to them to provide training at an event
* Executing two protests successfully
* Accepting their role is probationary until they have successfully run two protests

3.  We need to come with a way to put people onto the leadership council.
