# Indiana 50501 AI Art Policy

As an organization, Indiana 50501 does not support AI generated art for a variety of reasons:

* Ecological impact / Power usage
* Theft of artist's intellectual property
* Our respect for artists and the creative process

As such, we will NOT use AI generated art for any official communication on 50501 channels including our social media forums.

However, we are an organization that has a substantial commitment to free speech and, as such, we cannot and will not police or shame our members, even our leadership, if they use AI generated art on their personal social places even if it is to promote 50501 events.
