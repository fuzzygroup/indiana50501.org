# Job Description for Morgan Mullins, Welcoming Liaison and Strike Coordinator

## Title: Welcoming Liaison & Strike Coordinator

## Overview: Welcoming Liaison

As Welcoming Liaison, Morgan's role is to welcome new folks and get them into the right chat group.  This allows those people to self organize around LOCAL resources.  Morgan is a facilitator but NOT an admin on all the District # :: REGION groups.

## Overview: Strike Coordinator 

The idea of a general strike is powerful.  We have had no one looking at a state level strike and Morgan's husband is actually union which puts her closer to union stuff than anyone else we have. 

So her role a long term one -- to figure out what a general strike means and coordinate the resources needed to make it happen.
