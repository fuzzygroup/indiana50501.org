# About Scott Johnson / State Organizer Indiana 50501

Scott is the leader of 50501 in Indiana.  Taking over from Christian Hess, Scott has been an integral part of 
making 50501 Indiana successful.  Scott is a former software engineer turned full time activist.  Scott has a history of doing socially responsible things at the right time:

* When the Ukraine war started, Scott and his long time colleague Mark Bernstein stood up Pizza for Ukraine which initially let anyone in the world send a pizza to bomb shelters in Kiev.  This has evolved to taking donations which sponsor a soup kitchen.  This micro charity sends 100% of the money collected to Ukraine save the PayPal fees and has been continuously operating since 2022.
* During the pandemic, Scott build CovidNearMe which was the first covid tracker that sliced and diced the data right down to your county.
* Scott led engineering efforts for the first cut of the ADL's Online Hate Index which analyzed the right wing "Hate-O-Sphere"

Among the companies Scott has either founded or worked for are NTERGAID, Dataware, Feedster, AppData, the ADL and others.

From a technical perspective, Scott works with Ruby, Rails, Python and other technologies to build large Internet applications.

At this point, Scott has come out of retirement and is a full time activist leading Indiana 50501.
