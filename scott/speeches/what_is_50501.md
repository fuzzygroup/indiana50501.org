# What is 50501?

Understanding Indiana 50501 Speech

[Youtube Version of this](https://youtu.be/b6Q0zQTVbUE)

Hi

I'm Shaun Campbell.  I'm actually a bit nervous so please, please show me some grace.
This is the first time I've been in front of this many people ... ever?  *nervous laugh*

Note: This was originally ghost written by me for Shaun Campbell our Bloomington leader.

Like a lot of you, I'm:

* An Indiana Resident.  I live here and I work here.
* I love Indiana
* I am horrified at what I see in America
* And I think 50501 has the answers

So what is 50501?  Back in late January, all of less than 3 months ago, a bunch of Internet nerds on Reddit were spitballing -- as you do -- and they said something like this:

Wouldn't it be cool to run the SAME protest in 50 STATES and 50 CAPITALS at ONE TIME

**50501**

And unlike a lot of Internet nerds, they actually made it happen.  They put out a call to action that resulted in 

**2/5**

That was our first Indiana protest. 

And Indiana 50501 grew out of that.

We now have:

* A core signal group of 500+ users.  This is where core leadership hangs out and gets *stuff* done
* Social media channels from Facebook to YouTube to TikTok to Discord to Reddit to Blogspot
* Protests in Indianapolis that, on 4/5 had over 6,000 people in attendance; 4860 COUNTED PEOPLE
* Protests all over the state
* A firm commitment to non violence (yes we're non violent despite what happened in Lafayette)
* Leadership all over the state NOT just in Indianapolis
* A commitment to work with everyone; not just the big cities -- Hey -- I'm here right 


So what is 50501 ?

* Shock and awe for protests
* A grass roots organization across the country in every state
* A distributed organization that CANNOT be shut down

So what makes Indiana 50501 special ?
* Leadership
* Unlike most states, we have ONE 50501 organization in Indiana and for a grass roots thing, we are actually structured
* We organize at the:
    * State Level
        * Congressional District Level (we have Districts 5, 6, 7, 8 with leadership and we are working on others)
            * County Level (we just got our first county)
                * Town Level (not yet started)
* Vision
  * We have a plan
  * We aim to organize 288,000 people in Indiana

So now you're thinking something like this:

"Bunch of Internet weirdos.  These protests won't matter.  Protests don't ever change anything".

Let me tackle that:

1. Protests today WON'T CHANGE ANYTHING
2. Protests today are TRAINING US HOW TO PROTEST
    1. America forgot how to protest since the big movements of the 60s and the 70s
    2. Yes some groups still know how to do this but the bulk of us don't
3. Protests today are MAKING US FEEL BETTER
    1. "Action is the remedy for anxiety"
    2. I feel better since I started going to protests
    3. I don't feel alone; I have found my people -- Scott, Janet, Taelar and others are now my friends and I have access to a community of hundreds if not thousands of people.  Until that happens for you I can't describe how good it feels.
4. Protests today are SOURCING PEOPLE FOR THE MOVEMENT
    1. Let me clear -- I couldn't run a google ad to find you and get you motivated enough to join
    2. I don't have that much money or the ability to target you
    3. But I can run an event and you will attend
    4. And I'm going to look out at the crowd and I'm going find the people who:
        1. Cared enough to make a sign that was SMART
        2. Stayed around to talk to me
        3. Paid attention
        4. Pitched in 
        5. And those people will get my business card and then
        6. So I'm going to wait and see who contacts me
        7. And that's how I bring you into the fold
5. And the goal here is 3.5% of the population coming out to protest
    1. There's a Harvard historian / social scientist who has studied all of this and found
        1. in 53 % of the countries studied, non violent protests led to Authoritarian governments falling
        2. In 26 % of the cases, violent revolution led to Authoritarian governments falling
        3. The rest of the time they stayed in power
  2. In America, 3.5% is 11.5 million people
  3. In Indiana, 3.5% is 288,000 people

And that's what 50501 is:

* We are a movement that is focused on change
* We are 100% NON VIOLENT
* We believe America is in trouble
* We believe we are in a constitutional crisis
* We believe we are under authoritarian rule
* Don't believe it?  THERE IS A DISAPPEARED PERSON TRACKING WEBSITE in AMERICA RIGHT NOW.  Last time I checked over 1,200 people were abducted and disappeared  
* Don't believe it?  There is a concentration camp in America called KROME (spell it)  
* Don't believe it?  Trump has defied the courts fully  
* This is an illegal presidency that makes Nixon look like an amateur
* We want to see the administration out
* We believe that by protesting enough, we can do this
