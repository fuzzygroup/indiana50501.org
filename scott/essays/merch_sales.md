# Adding Merch Sales to 50501 Events

There is an old statement that **money changes everything** and that's likely true.  As 50501 Indiana isn't a charity -- and can't be -- we need to accept a few basic facts:

1. People want to give us money.  We are perceived as a charity whether or not we are.
2. People giving us money actually makes them feel good.  That is actually pretty important.  We'd prefer their time but we will take their money if we must.
3. We can have inflated prices for basic things (stickers) because people will perceive it as a donation rather than a price for value.

## Scott's Rules for Merch Sales

1. These aren't sales; they are donations.  Wording matters (see Sara).
2. Our financials HAVE TO BE ABSOLUTELY TRANSPARENT.  I have arranged for a quasi accountant friend to take all our receipts and get them entered into a google spreadsheet so we can learn what it costs us to produce a protest, etc. I hope to see that data next week.
3. We are going to need to produce some kind of monthly operating document.
4. I am setting up a separate bank account this morning to prevent co-mingling of funds.  This bank account will be in my name or something like DBA Indiana 50501 since we aren't legally anything.  Someone other than me needs to be added to this account to allow for access to funds in the event of a catastrophe (aka Trump arresting Scott).
5. As we generate economic activity, we need to be sensitive about people's perceptions.
