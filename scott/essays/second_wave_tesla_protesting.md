# The Second Wave of Tesla Protesting

I can't say that I was the first person to protest Tesla but I can say that I was **early**.  And I have been consistent, protesting almost every day since I started.  And I have certainly benefitted from protesting Tesla:

* I got to know the people at my local Tesla dealership and they are actually good folks just doing their job
* I have honed my abilities to speak with MAGA folk and learned from it
* I have dramatically bolstered by "Speak to Anyone" skills and I am no longer at all shy about talking to random folks
* I have recruited people to our events just by being present with a sign
* I have gotten free drinks, free food and free cookies just for doing good work

And, now, I am seriously wondering if it is time to move from the first wave of Tesla protesting -- in person protesting of Tesla -- to the second wave of Tesla Protesting -- moving it **online**.

## Sidebar: This Only Applies to America

If you are outside of America and protesting Tesla then I sincerely say **THANK YOU**.  My thoughts on moving to online only protesting of Tesla are strictly for America so outside of America, CARRY ON!!!

## The second wave of Tesla protesting

The first wave of Tesla protesting was physical protesting at Tesla locations such as:

* Dealerships
* Collision Centers
* SuperChargers

This past week, however, has brought up the prospects of real danger for Tesla protestors:

* [A Florida man attempted to drive his car into Tesla protestors](https://abcnews.go.com/US/florida-man-arrested-after-driving-car-protesters-tesla/story?id=120094773)
* [A California man attempted to use a Taser on Tesla protestors](https://electrek.co/2025/03/24/trump-supporter-arrested-at-tesla-protest-after-using-a-taser-video/)
* [Attorney General Pam Bondi has threatened 20 year sentences without the possibility of parole for people who mess with Tesla](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/pam-bondi-tesla-protests-musk-domestic-terrorism-claims-rcna197941)
* [An FBI task force for domestic terrorism for Tesla has been established](https://www.wishtv.com/news/fbi-task-force-domestic-terrorism-tesla/?utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook_WISH-TV&fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAR10mDNL7bNmoJo_O5lhTZNwJVj0NkMU5uDkIZ2u5qHL42SrgcD6DEqiUgA_aem_MEd11beiZnMeR-BP3R7NWA)
* [It is now a hate crime to vandalize a Tesla in Washington, DC](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2025/03/27/elon-musk-tesla-vandalism-hate-crime-washington-dc-00252290)

I know some protestors will view me as cowardly for even mentioning the possibility of backing off physically protesting Tesla.  My point is that if we go to jail, we lose the ability to negatively impact Tesla in any way -- and then Musk wins.

My thinking is that we need to keep the Tesla pressure up but do it online:

* Go on test drives of other electric cars and, if they are good, leave GLOWING, SPECTACULAR reviews
* Go on test drives of Teslas and, since we know they will be bad, leave NEGATIVE, HORRIBLE, AWFUL reviews
* Focus on all the bad news endemic to Tesla like the fact that FSD kills.  Go to these locations and leave flowers and then write them up online.  [TeslaDeaths.com site](https://www.tesladeaths.com/) / [Wikipedia FSD Crashes](https://www.tesladeaths.com/)

Ultimately the goal here is to utterly ruin Tesla's stock valuation and hurt Musk in the wallet so let's do that but not go to jail in the process.  

I think this is achievable.
