# Assessing Your Personal Protest Risk 

I had a very interesting meeting with someone in the Indiana 50501 community who had these personal characteristics:

* Married
* Spouse is pregnant
* 1 small child already in the relationship (4 ish years old)
* Spouse has a green card
* Spouse falls into the category of "brown" (Peruvian) 

Note: Please do not hate on me for how I'm representing race.  This is the not the time for pearl clutching.  Addressing race head on in a open manner when we have ICE literally abducting brown people in public and there is an actual [DISAPPEARED PERSONS TRACKER](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/danielleharlow/viz/UnitedStatesDisappearedTracker/Map) is **absolutely essential**.

My advice to him was simple, direct and clear: 

**Don't Go to Protests Anymore**

And you can be sure that a small bit of my belief in America *died* when I told him that.  The simple truth here is that their spouse is likely **already on a list** just due to the green card.  And, in today's world, security cameras and social media coverage can pretty easily identify you by correlation with your drivers license photo.  Yes we had a crowd of thousands but he can still be picked out if the right camera grabs him.

From my perspective, the intersection of brown, green card and pregnant was the killer trifecta.  We already know that:

* The Trump administration has a cavalier attitude towards deportation. 
* At least one concentration camp, [Krome](https://www.miamitimesonline.com/news/local/miami-dems-demand-krome-detention-center-tour-amid-reports-of-inhumane-conditions/article_ad3196bb-4600-4464-a6b1-6b7840240740.html), is currently operating in America and is 10X overcrowded.

What happens if the spouse is sent to Krome?  What is the likelihood of actual medical care?  What happens to a pregnant woman in crowded conditions?

Protesting in America is about to **change**.  The April 5 protests were an inflection point and I believe the Trump administration has taken note -- the fences at the White House are back up.  We all need to assess our personal risk profile and make rational, informed decisions about the risks we are facing.  

Just as an example, my kids are 18 and 23.  And I have provided my family with comfortable financial resources.  This means that if I end up in a South American Gulag, my family will be ok.  I mean I suspect they will miss me but they will be ok.
