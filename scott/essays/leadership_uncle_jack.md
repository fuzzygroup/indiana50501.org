# Indiana 50501 Leadership: What Uncle Jack Taught Me

If you look at Indiana 50501, I believe that that we are more effective than other states. Admittedly I am the State Organizer so I could be biased.  What I think makes us effective is **leadership**.  All of us in senior leadership aka "The OG State Leadership** council of 5 have been unafraid to make decisions.  And all leadership does come down to a combination of:  * The ability to make decisions
* The judgement to make good decisions
* The ability to take decisive action when needed
* The ability to admit when you are wrong and own up to your mistakes

Now I I learned my leadership style over the course of my life from many places: 

* Growing up in family business
* Building companies
* Working for incredibly dysfunctional companies 
* An awful lot of reading

One of the best leadership techniques I ever learned, my Uncle Jack taught me and it is very, very simple:

**You show up in person**

My uncle Jack is one of the most effective business leaders I've ever met, and I spent my life working in high tech alongside the ostensible greats. My uncle ran a distributed business with thousands of employees over a network of states that spanned the East Coast.  There will likely never be a book written about him but he was (and is) a great business man.

What my Uncle taught me, and not my word but by deed, was something I saw him do week after week.  He had facilities in state after state and I would see him get in his car, go to a facility and just show up.  He'd meet with his managers, talk to customers and so on.  I have no idea how many miles he drove.  And I don't think he ever had a driver.

Now I am not running a multi state business, but I am organizing an **entire state**.  Two weeks ago, I talked to one of my regional leaders and i got that itchy feeling along the back of my neck that said "danger will robinson".  So, I got in my car and made a 3.5 hour pilgrimage from Indianapolis to their congressional district to **show up**. 

In an age of distributed online crap, zoom calls, text messages, phone calls, etc., there still is no substitute for actual face time. There is no substitute for the simple human act of showing up.  All I did when I drove down to that congressional district was sit down with our organizer and listen. Never disparage the basic humanity of doing something like listening and, best of all, we did it over food. We broke bread together.

I'd love to think that I would've been smart enough to get in my car and go see my district organizer when they were in trouble if I hadn't grown up with an uncle Jack, but I don't know that to be true.
