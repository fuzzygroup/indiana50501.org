# Shred Project 2025 Event Plan

Here's how I see the day going.

## Setup

**SETUP STARTS AT 8 AM AND DOES NOT INCLUDE PANCAKES.**

**PANCAKES MAY BE ORDERED AND BROUGHT OVER BUT NO GUARANTEE**

**Sara is Setup Leader**

1. Sara gives the directions and we all report to Sara including me.  She has extensive event experience and she is good at this.  
2. Roles include: Scott and Dave lead engineering and carpentry.  Dave doesn't lift one damn thing (back trouble).  Carlos leads audio.

Rough Setup Order but Sara may change this.  Also this happens in parallel:

* We setup the the popup up top of the stairs as per last time.
* We use the new pop up levelers so it is HORIZONTAL
* At the base of the stairs we add a platform to setup a shredder which is publicly viewable and is strong enough for a person to stand on (Scott and Dave)
* We may have a second shredder; TBD
* Shredder has to be feeding its output into a bin or trashcan for the Seed Bomb crew to work with it
* The card board cut outs of Vought and Miller have to be set up around the shredder. These will be treated like paper dolls that are dressed like prisoners in the south american jail
* We setup a literal gong (I think I have what I need to make a gong) next to it; we can ask people from the audience to "Ring the Gong for pages 202 to 203 which just got shredded"
* We setup tables and the like and speakers and such. 
* Along the walkway in we have a set of 4 3/8" sheets of AC plywood laid out where a table can take canned foods and they can shape the cans into a map of indiana (think Gencon card sculpture).  The theme of the food drive is BRING A CAN. SHRED A PAGE. And people who bring food can tear a page out of a categorized binder of project 2025 like "ANTI WOMAN", "TARIFFS"
* They bring the page to a hand maiden how feeds it into a shredder
* One of the setup tables on the walk way right next to the canned food drive is the DONALD TRUMP CHALLENGE game where they can roll a dice and make a video saying something like "My Roll Gives Trump's Presidency 3 more months" or "My roll has Donald Trump dying from orange make up poisoning"

## Setup Plan UNLOADING Step by Step

1. We unload EVERYTHING by pulling the van right up to the sidewalk at the right spot and we unload from there.  Someone other than Scott sits in the van and keeps parking legal while the unload is done.
2. The 3/8" plywood for the canned good stacking goes out first.
3. The table for **Bring a Can. Shred a Page** goes out next.  And 2 chairs.
4. The binders for **Bring a Can.  Shred a Page** come out 
5. The table for Donald Trump Challenge comes out next and the tote with the Dice Tower and the Dice
6. And so on (to be filled out further)

## Bring a Can.  Shred a Page.  Our Canned Food Drive.

We have extra copies of Project 2025 at a table where canned goods are dropped off.  As they drop them off, they can rip out pages and bring them to a shredder.

### The Project 2025 Books

We need to setup a series of loose leaf binders (likely 3 volumes) which have a categorized set of pages for the project with categories like:

* ANTI TRANS
* ANTI GAY
* ANTI READING SPICY FICTION
* PRO TARIFFS
* KILL GOVERNMENT BENEFITS
* GUT US AID
* ANTI IMMIGRANT 

and make dividers so people can easily flip thru and find what they want to shred.

We need at least 3 sets and maybe more.  Everyone that drops off a can can use these.

## The Donald Trump Challenge Dice Game

Next to the Bring a Can; Shred a Page table will be a table run by Jacquelyn Montenaro where people can roll a die to find out:

* When the trump presidency ends
* How he dies

And there should be a video booth next to so people can hold up their die and may a clip saying "I rolled Trump is out in 6 weeks"

## The Event - Part 1

I give the opening.

First Musician Is Up (Jen)

We get our NON Project 2025 speakers done.

We Chant in Place.

## The Event - Part II

* We have a procession of hand maids bring in a copy of project 2025 and carry it up to the podium
* The event begins
* We have the first speaker give their speech and end with something like:  "And this is real.  It is covered on Pages 302 to 305".
* They rip the pages out and hand them to a waiting hand maid who takes it down the steps to the shredder
* They feed it into the shredder
* Lather / Rinse / Repeat for each speaker 
* Last Speaker is Max Haddad

## The Event - Part III - Second Musician

We bring out Dave McCarty's partner.

## The Event - Part III - Closing Speech

I give the closing speech and I say something like "AND NOW WE MARCH"

## The Event - Part IV - We March

We group the zones of the areas where people are by color and we have March Leaders at the end closest to the street EACH with:

* Megaphones
* Chant Cards

We put at the mid point chant reinforcers also with megaphones

12 megaphones total plus 48 C batteries

And I say "RED LEADER GO".

And then they go and I give the next color but we start with RED LEADER
