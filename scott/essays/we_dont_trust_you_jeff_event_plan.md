# We Don't Trust You Jeff Event Plan

Here's how I see the day going.

## Senior Staff / Key People Present

* Scott
* Brian
* Tori (after 1)
* Sara
* Amy
* Kim (until 4 pm at which point she is BANISHED from the scene to goto work)
* Pride
* Jacquelyn

## Senior Staff / Key People  Missing

* No Janet
* No Taelar
* No Felecia
* No Kay
* No Morgan (which was poorly handled imho)

## Setup

**SETUP STARTS AT 8 AM AND DOES NOT INCLUDE PANCAKES.**

**PANCAKES MAY BE ORDERED AND BROUGHT OVER BUT NO GUARANTEE**

**Sara is Setup Leader**

1. Sara gives the directions and we all report to Sara including me.  She has extensive event experience and she is good at this.  
2. Roles include: Brian and Amy lead stage creation and assembly.  Scott will assist.  
3. Scott handles Audio setup with assistance from Angel as he is available.

Rough Setup Order but Sara may change this.  Also this happens in parallel:

* We setup all the popups for partners.
* We setup the the popup at the base of the long plaza.
* We use the new pop up levelers as weights.
* We setup the stage in front of the popup.  
* How the popup integrates with the stage is TBD.  Brian???  
* In front of the stage, we will have a number of things including the Smashatron 5000, another popup for the video shooting and video streaming, speakers on stands.
* We setup tables and the like and speakers and such. 
* Along the walkway in we have a canvas or vinyl tarp which is painted like Indiana on which canned food can be placed.

## Van Loading Order

The things we need FIRST need to be on the tail end of the van.  Yes this is obvious.  Yes we screwed this up.  So load order is as follows:

1. Audio equipment all the way to the back.
2. Lectern to the back.
3. Totes to the back.
4. Tables on the left hand side so they can be gotten to easily.
5. Popups on the end.
6. Hand truck and wagons on the end.
7. Popup weights on the end.  My thinking is bottles of water. A gallon of water is 8 pounds.  4 gallons per popup would give a ton of weight for each popup.  Given the predicted thunderstorms, that is likely needed.  We have 8 popups total so we'd need 8*4=32 gallons of water.  We would tie a cord between each gallon and dangle them from the frame.

## Setup Plan UNLOADING Step by Step

1. We unload EVERYTHING by pulling the van and Brian's truck with the stage right up to the sidewalk at the right spot and we unload from there.  Someone other than Scott sits in the van and someone other than Brian sits in the truck and keeps parking legal while the unload is done.
2. The tarp for the canned good stacking goes out first.
3. The table for **Food Donation** goes out next.  And 2 chairs.
4. The other tables follow in succession with popups being placed over the tables as they become available.

## The Event - Block 1 - OPENING & KEYNOTE

I give the opening.  This will be my standard The Good and The Bad.

We will have 3 speakers -- Resisting Oracle, Brad Lorton and Deonye who will then lead the march.

## The Event - Block 2 - MARCH

This is the March.

## The Event - Block 3 - CATCH UP

These are our catch up speakers who got bumped last time.  

NO ONE CAN BE BUMPED THIS TIME NO MATTER HOW UNHAPPY THE CROWD IS.

## The Event - Block 4 - THE AMAZON CONTENT

These are our anti Amazon speakers.

My guess is that Hippie doesn't make it to the event since she's pretty strapped right now.

## The Event - Block 5 - THE SMASHING

This is our execution of the Smash-a-Tron 5000.

## The Event - Block 6 - Picnic / Networking / Teardown

This may be hard to do based on weather.
