# The Vicki Spartz Question

With Vicki Spartz moving her Westfield town hall to the IMMI location, we have a question -- what do we do?  After reading the forum and talking with people extensively, it seems like there are two options:

1. Attend the IMMI location, write our signs on our shirts and try and ask questions to get our points across.
2. Run a counter town hall in a location of our choosing and simply put out the word that we are doing this.  The fact that our Governor Braun thing had 3 different press folks show up with less than a day's notice means that we can get press.

## Attend the IMMI Location

In this option, we:

1. Arrive early to try and get ourselves into the queue.
2. Arrive in force to make sure that a lot of people are there.
3. Write our signs on our shirts, covered by a jacket, that we take off as we approach the podium.
4. Ask our questions.

### Pros

* Simplest to do 
* Participates in democratic process
* Should intersect with press coverage

### Cons

* I am very concerned about security.  I may be getting paranoid but it feels as if the tenor of the country is changing.  We know she is working for DOGE so she may have DOGE security staff / DOGE money.  And they don't care.
* I think our presentation needs to be respectful and technically accurate if we are confronting her directly.  If we go rogue / get angry, we can expect to get forcibly removed.  And these days I don't know that forcibly removed doesn't mean Venezuelan prison.  I know that's crazy but we still don't know the location of Mahmoud.

## Counter Town Hall

This is the basic strategy that we've had all along when it didn't look like Spartz was going to show.  Last night I asked Jackson if he could get us the hall she cancelled.

In this option:

1. We setup at the original location.
2. We bring the big speakers, the swag, etc.
3. We notify the press; we notify our partner orgs; we try and really get the word out.
4. We have a point person facilitating the event and let people really air their grievances.
5. We capture the video and get it all online.
6. We might be able to park a car with a sign somewhere in visual range of her event saying "COUNTER TOWN HALL - ORIGINAL LOCATION - COME NOW".

### Pros

* Safe
* Possibly high profile
* Gets us practice at running a new type of event

### Cons

* Possibly low profile
* Not participating in democratic process (but they aren't listening either; I'm more concerned about these things as recruiting events than them fixing the syste,m)
