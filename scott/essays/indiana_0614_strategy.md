# The Indiana 6/14 Strategy

50501 National and Indivisible National have both come out and stated:

"6/14 is Trump's Birthday.  Let's protest"

And I get their rationale but I think it is a **wrong** rationale.  Here's what we know:

1. Trump hates gay people.
2. Trump hates Trans people.
3. Pride is a celebration of LGBTQ everything.
4. Pride is thus inherently ANTI Trump.
5. Pride is the LGBTQ community's big blow out event of the year.  
6. Running a protest at the same time as 6/14 is a bad idea; it pulls people away from Pride.
7. The LGBTQ community has massively supported 50501 from the very start.  We want to recognize that support and give back to that community.

Here's my solution:

1. On 6/14, Indiana 50501 goes all in on support for Pride.  We march in the parade, run a table, etc.  The number of people at pride is roughly 4X our largest protest ever.
2. On 6/15. Indiana 50501 runs a Dads for Democracy or some such event in Noblesville.  I was approached this week by an Angie Foreman (a Greg Zeismer contact) who wants 50501 to run an event in Hamilton County and she and I have been able to find consensus on it.  I think we can do this in an easier fashion than our normal huge protest so that allows for us being active on two weekend days.

This has been discussed with Kim / Belladonna and Ron Newlin of Indivisible.

## Tasks We Need to Do

Here are the tasks we need to execute on:

1. Get messaging out there that Indy Pride is RESISTING TRUMP.  This needs to be a consistent message we need to promote from 5/26 forward.
2. Get people stationed at the State House from say 11:30 to 2:30 with fliers promoting pride and the 6/15 event.  
3. Get an event planned and in progress for 6/15 in Noblesville.  This is a Scott Johnson and Angie Foreman task and will be done with our new planing software.
4. Print several thousand rainbow whistles for distribution.
