# Joining 50501

Joining 50501 is a bit like herding cats.  There are a bunch of ways you can participate but the best way is to join one of our discussion communities, Discord or Signal.  Signal is where the core leadership **lives**.  And if you really want to be involved then follow the link below, strike up a conversation with leadership, for vetting and then join the fray.

[Chat with Leadership on Signal](https://indiana50501.org/joinsignal/)

Note: Discord details are coming as are other means to join us.  This page went up in a rush.
