# Joining 50501

Joining 50501 is a bit like herding cats.  There are a bunch of ways you can participate but the best way is to join one of our discussion communities, Discord or Signal.  Signal is where the core leadership **lives**.  And if you really want to be involved then follow the link below, strike up a conversation with Scott, the State Organizer, for vetting and then join the fray.

[Chat with Scott on Signal](https://signal.me/#eu/gJNSLuZKHvokYlcvqmaZ28SkhovlHEEkjbEJY6hPdcYEOH8xgOhNl516alS-YW4I)

Note: Discord details are coming as are other means to join us.  This page went up in a rush.
