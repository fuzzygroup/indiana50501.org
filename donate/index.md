# How to Donate to Us

## How Can I Donate Some Cash to Help You Guys?

You can't.  Organizationally the founding team of Indiana 50501 has made the decision to NOT organize traditionally:

* We will not be a 501(c)(3)
* We will not be a 501(c)(4)
* We will not be a political action committee (PAC)

Our thinking is simple: Each of these organization types place limits on our free speech and activities.  And, if we are the resistance, which we are, we **cannot** accept these restrictions.

When the administration, nay, regime comes for us, they will do it one of two ways:

* Lawyers
* Police

The administration will start action against us with lawyers.  If we simply do not accept cash then we can't be in violation of tax laws (always remember that Al Capone went to jail for tax evasion not the dozens of other crimes he committed).

Our funding model is simple and community driven.  We now have a group chat on our Signal called:

 _WE NEED

This discussion forum can only be posted in by admins and, in it, you might see something like: 

2 cases of water for the 4/8 protest

And, hopefully, someone in our community will step up and make that purchase and then get them to us.

And, before you ask about gift cards, no we aren't taking them:

* There is potential for abuse of gift cards as we scale the organization.  We believe in radical honesty and radical transparency.  Money is a corrupting factor so let's eliminate it where we can.
* Gift cards is a legal technique to avoid donation laws.  Anyone want to bet that the Administration's lawyers won't argue in court that gift cards are really money and thus subject to taxes?

So our funding model is simple:

* We will tell our community publicly what we need
* Our community may or may not step up and help
