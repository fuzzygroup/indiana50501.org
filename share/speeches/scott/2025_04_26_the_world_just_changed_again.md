# Speech: The World Just Changed Again 

Good morning everyone.  I am Scott Johnson, State Organizer of Indiana 50501

I need to make people aware that the world changed again yesterday.

And it is not a good change.  

And, yes, I know that's obvious in the hell scape that we are all enduring but still ...

I have thought long and hard about what I am about to say.

I have sought the advice of my fellow 50501 leadership.

And I am following the dictates of my conscience.

Now brace yourself people.  

This is a long one but if I can wake up at 3 am to write it, clean myself up, stage it and 

get on camera, you can listen.

**THANK YOU FOR LISTENING**

**THANK YOU FOR SHARING**




## Change The First: Kilmar Abrego Garcia Will Not Be Coming Home

Yep.  That's right.  Abrego Garcia, the man that was MISTAKENLY sent to Venezuela for NOTHING.  

It was stated that he will not be coming home.  

This man has an American wife and 3 children and is innocent

President Trump was taught politics by a man named Roy Cohn and one of the things that Roy Cohn 

taught Trump is that you NEVER, EVER ADMIT YOU ARE WRONG.

And thanks to that INSANE, ARROGANT, DESPICABLE teaching, 

an innocent man,

who has never been convicted of a crome, 

a man with an American wife 

has been sent to a South American Gulag

I STAND WITH ABREGO GARCIA

NOW IF YOU LOOK AT CHAIR NEXT TO ME, HERE IN INDY WE CALL THIS 

"CHAIRS FOR THE DISAPPEARED"  Today it is also Chairs for the Arrested

You're going to see this again and again at the events out of Indiana 50501 

This will be a feature of our permanent event process moving forward.

I wasn't going to unveil this until our 5/1 protest but to hell with that

Our Chairs for the Disappeared starts today and the first one is for

ABREGO GARCIA

My thanks go out to our event leader Sara who helped me with the staging for this

and to my eldest son who gave me the idea of Chairs for the Departed.  Thank you Alex.



## Change The Second: Two Judges Have Been Arrested

The next change was ...

No

I can't even say that it is more serious

I can't say it is less serious

IT JUST IS 

AND IT IS A TRAVESTY

Abrego Garcia is a tragedy on a personal scale

This is a tragedy in terms of being A CORRUPTION OF JUSTICE

President Trump HAD TWO JUDGES ARRESTED:

* Judge Hannah Dugan of the Milwaukee County Circuit was charged with two felonies on grounds that she was "trying to help an undocumented migrant avoid arrest after he appeared in her courtroom".  This happened Friday the 25th
* And on Thursday the 24th, a former New Mexico judge and his wife were arrested on charges related to their reported harboring of an undocumented immigrant with ties to the Tren de Aragua gang.

Oh for heaven's sake people -- THE PRESIDENT IS JUST MAKING THIS CRAP UP

Let's just say the obvious out loud:

President Trump is an unrepentant racist and if you are black or brown he is coming for you

And if you stand with black or brown, he is coming for you

JUDGE HANNAH DUGAN of MILWAUKEE WAS ARRESTED

Last week it was police in Boston, the bluest of states, breaking into a car with sledge hammers 

Yesterday it was a WHITE FEMALE JUDGE IN MILWAUKEE

TOMORROW IT COULD BE ME

IT COULD BE YOU



## Change the Third: The FBI Made the Arrests of the Judges

Now here's the thing my fellow Americans --

THE FBI MADE THESE ARRESTS

And I might be wrong but my understanding of the law is that 

US MARSHALLS should have made that arrest

So what Trump did yesterday was break the spine of an organization whose 

very name actually means something profound

FBI

FIDELITY

BRAVERY

INTEGRITY

Well I'm sorry but the FBI NO LONGER DESERVES THAT NAME

So here's my new sign:

** holds up sign **

Men and women of the FBI, I used to look up to you.  

I used to believe in your name.  

And maybe that's silly but I'm believe in integrity.  

I believe that the institutions of America mean something

But, apparently, being in the FBI NO LONGER MATTERS.  

You have all dishonored yourselves today.

Every single FBI agent should have walked off the job before 1 of them arrested 

Judge Hannah Dugan

This is a stain on the FBI's very soul and it will NOT wash away




## So Why Does This Matter -- What Happened

I'm sure some of you are like "Oh no.  Scott's making a big deal again".

No.  You don't get to say that.

Let me repeat myself:

* An innocent man, a man who government attorneys agree was deported by mistake, was told he's never coming because the INSANE RACIST, FASCIST TYRANT in the White House is such a toddler that he can't admit he's wrong
* Our own government is now arresting the very people, the judges who determine right from wrong
* The FBI, the premier law enforcement agency in the world, has had their spine broken



## And Now This Brings Up - What Do We Do ?

I'm with 50501 and we believe in non violent protesting.  That's what we do.

I think it is time for Americans to step up their involvement in protesting.

And we need to do it together

Not as 50501
 Not as Indivisible

Not as Hands Off

As Americans

THIS IS WRONG ON EVERY DAMN LEVEL

I would like to see 3 actions come out this.



## ACTION 1: I WANT MORE PEOPLE TO GIVE THIS SPEECH

I have put the text of this speech in the /share/scott section of the Indiana 50501 website and that means anyone 

can go on YouTube or TikTok and give this speech.  

I  have also given this speech to the 50501 AYD chat which unites all state leaders.  

I hope that others in State Leadership give this speech today.

And I want everyone giving it to tag four other people to give this speech

My four people are:

Brian

Sara

Amy

RESISTING ORACLE

You know who you are

You are welcome to use my set or do it however you want.

Oh and if you're in the Indiana area and you want to use my set to give a version of this, just come on by



## ACTION 2: WE NEED TO PROTEST ON THE REGULAR - EVERY FRIDAY


It is now time for Americans to protest on the regular -- EVERY FRIDAY.  

This isn't my idea.  A Marjorie Lee in the 50501 Movement chat on Facebook called for it AND SHE WAS RIGHT.  

That's what they did in South Korea and it worked

Starting Friday May 2nd, I will be running a protest here in Indiana EVERY FRIDAY NIGHT UNTIL THIS ENDS.  

And there will be no speakers.  

There will be no musicians.   

There will be no props

This is back to basics.  

It will be people with signs. 

No I don't know where.  

No I don't know the time.  

That will come out later this week when I speak further with my leadership team.  

For now, make your sign.  

Get ready.

And just to be clear, there will still be our big events

There will still be our 5/1, 5/17 and 5/25 events

So hold those dates!

But EVERY FRIDAY NIGHT WE GO BACK TO BASICS -- PEOPLE WITH SIGNS



## ACTION 3: IT IS TIME TO PROTEST THE FBI

Finally It is time to protest the good people at the FBI.

We will start at the FBI building here in Fishers / Castleton near Costco

Now.  50501 protests have, so far, been an anarchic, chaotic, diverse group of people

We have been a MOB

IT IS TIME FOR US TO BE AN ARMY   WE MUST HAVE CONSISTENCY

AND LET ME BE CLEAR. 

WE ARE A NON VIOLENT ARMY

BUT WE MUST BE UNITED

WE MUST SHOW THE FBI THAT THERE VERY NAME NO LONGER MEANS ANYTHING AT ALL

SO HERE IS MY SIGN  ** SHOWS SIGN ** 

MAKE YOUR SIGN  HAVE SIMILAR MESSAGING

SHOW THE FBI THAT THEY HAVE LOST THEIR HONOR



## IN CLOSING, THIS IS WHERE EVERYONE OTHER THAN ME ENDS THEIR SPEECH

AND, DAMN IT, DO NOT DO WHAT I AM ABOUT TO DO

I DON'T WANT ANYONE ELSE GIVING THIS SPEECH TO MIRROR MY ACTIONS FROM THIS POINT FORWARD

And now President Trump, it is time for you to complete your transition into a full on fascist so I'm going to make it easy for you

My name is **Scott Johnson**

I am the **State Organizer of Indiana 50501**

So President Trump, 

I know you're coming for ordinary Americans next so feel free to send your minions for me

After all, I have done nothing wrong just like Abrego Garcia, just like Hannah Dugan

My only **crime** is I DON'T AGREE WITH YOU AND THAT SEEMS TO BE ALL IT TAKES IN 2025

SO BRING IT ON

And, in closing, I have to quote Edmund Burke:  The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing

I will not do nothing

My name is Scott Johnson and I ask that you share this far and wide
