# Speech The World Just Changed Again Short

Hi.  I am Scott Johnson, State Organizer of Indiana 50501

The world changed again yesterday in a bad way

I have a long version of this over on YouTube but here's the short and sweet version

## Kilmar Abrego Garcia will not be coming home

Yep.  That's right.  Abrego Garcia, the man that was MISTAKENLY sent to Venezuela for NOTHING.  

For now reason other than President Trump WILL NOT ADMIT THAT HE MADE A MISTAKE

An innocent man is sentenced to a south american GULAG

Look to my left and my right and you will see the CHAIRS FOR THE DISAPPEARED

TODAY IT IS ALSO CHAIRS FOR THE ARRESTED

HERE IN INDIANA WE STAND WITH KILMAR ABREGO GARCIA

## TWO JUDGES WERE ARRESTED

On Friday the 25th and Thursday the 24th, President Trump had two judges arrested

You heard me -- the sitting American President arrested two of his own judges

The men and who are responsible for JUSTICE are now being arrested

Oh for heaven's sake people -- THE PRESIDENT IS JUST MAKING THIS CRAP UP

Let's just say the obvious out loud:

President Trump is an unrepentant racist and if you are black or brown he is coming for you

And if you stand with black or brown, he is coming for you

JUDGE HANNAH DUGAN of MILWAUKEE WAS ARRESTED

Last week it was police in Boston, the bluest of states, breaking into a car with sledge hammers 

Yesterday it was a WHITE FEMALE JUDGE IN MILWAUKEE

TOMORROW IT COULD BE ME

IT COULD BE YOU

And the worst of it is this

## THE FBI MADE THESE ARRESTS

An organization who's motto is 

Fidelity

Bravery

Integrity

Betrayed their very motto this week when they made these arrests

And don't ignore that the legal fact that the US Marshalls are the agency that has responsibility for arresting the Judiciary

The only reason to use the FBI was to break their will, to savage their integrity

So ... Here's my new sign 

** holds up sign ** 

Men and women of the FBI I used to look up to you

Now, no.  You need to walk past my sign when you go to work

Every single FBI agent should have walked off the job before 1 of them arrested Judge Hannah Dugan

This is a stain on the FBI's very soul and it will not wash away

## So What Do We Do

Indiana 50501 is making some changes.  Here's what they are.

1. The text of this speech is freely available and I want as many Americans to give it as possible.  See indiana50501.org/share/ to get a copy 
2. We are moving to protesting at the State House every Friday night from 4 to 6.  If I'm the only one there then so be it.  But I will be there.
3. We will be adding protests at the Fishers / Castleton Offices of the FBI on Tuesday and Thursday from 12 to 1.  This lets people come over lunch.  

## And in Closing

And now President Trump, it is time for you to complete your transition into a full on fascist so I'm going to make it easy for you

My name is **Scott Johnson**

I am the **State Organizer of Indiana 50501**

So President Trump, 

I know you're coming for ordinary Americans next so feel free to send your minions for me

After all, I have done nothing wrong just like Abrego Garcia, just like Hannah Dugan

My only **crime** is I DON'T AGREE WITH YOU AND THAT SEEMS TO BE ALL IT TAKES IN 2025

SO COME GET ME

And, in closing, I have to quote Edmund Burke:

The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing

I will not do nothing

My name is Scott Johnson, State Organizer Indiana 50501 and I ask that you share this far and wide
