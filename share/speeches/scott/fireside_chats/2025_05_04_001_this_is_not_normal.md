Scott's Fireside Chat 001 : This Is Not Normal

Hi there.  You might have seen me before.

That's particularly true if you are in the Indiana area

My name is Scott Johnson and I'm the State Organizer of Indiana 50501

I am, amazingly, a Full Time Political Activist.

I say amazingly because before February 5, 2025, I was ABSOLUTELY politically unaware

Then I went to my first protest

And, as they say, the rest was history

And, no, I am not paid. 

I am literally a "UNPAID PROTESTOR",  

That's why I wear this shirt because I am mocking what our "president" says about myself and my fellow brothers and sisters on the streets of America every day of the week.

And if my 3 months of political activity has taught me anything it is that if the RIGHT says it about the LEFT it is because the RIGHT is doing it and the left is so uncoordinated that they are not

So who am I?

* I am a father to two sons - 18 and 23
* I am an engineer
* I am a cook
* I am a creator
* I am a reader
* I am a writer 
* I am a wood worker
* I am a proud software engineer
* I am a 3d printer
* I am an Apple User who has been a Mac fan since 86
* I am OG internet - I built my first web stuff in 84
* I am an entrepreneur
* I am a Political Activist
* I am a wealthy individual and I have used my own money to fund Indiana 50501

* And

* I am an American who is appalled at the state of his country

And just to be clear, I am only a man with a phone, the ability to write and a damn fireplace.  

No one else writes my words; I wrote this script about 60 minutes before shooting it when I woke up at 2 am and felt inspired

My fellow Americans, to quote Ben Meiselas of the Meidas Touch Network 

THIS IS NOT NORMAL

So let's recap some of the crazy of the past 100 odd days:

* An American President does not sell cars from the White House Lawn
* An American President does not let the RICHEST MAN in the world and IN HUMAN HISTORY use his office for a press conference while his small child picks his nose, wipes it on the desk and then tells the President YOU'RE NOT IN CHARGE
* An American President does not RULE by executive orders alone
* An American President does not deport American Children including one with cancer
* An American President does not manipulate the stock market by announcing and then cancelling tariffs repeatedly.  This is a PUMP and DUMP scheme.  ANYONE ELSE WOULD BE IN JAIL FOR MARKET MANIPULATION
* An American President doesn't make his own citizens poorer by wrecking the stock market 
* An American President does not announce that he is going to confiscate an entire country - GAZA and convert it to a resort
* An American President doesn't announce claims to ethnically cleanse Palestinians
* An American President does not have a woman abducted off the streets of Boston and then disappeared for the ostensible crime of writing in a student newspaper 
* An American President does not have the military take over 170 MILES of territory in Texas along the southern border
* An American President does not abandon the rest of the world and turn inward
* An American President does not take food from the poorest people in the world
* An American President does not JAIL his own judges
* An American President does not turn his back on the constitution
* An American President does not sit the richest men in the world in front of his own legislators at the Inauguration 
* An American President does not lie to his people over and over and create a false narrative of a country in peril
* An American President does not HATE
* President Trump IS NOT NORMAL
* President Trump WAS NOT A SELF MADE BUSINESS MAN -- his father left him almost $500 million and President Trump is such a bad business man that he had 6 bankruptcies including a CASINO.  Yes that's right he couldn't even correctly run a CASINO the literal business where THE HOUSE ALWAYS WINS
* President Trump is a CONVICTED SEXUAL ASSAULTIST -- and yes my wording is careful there because of an insane law in New York State which literally says that if you forcibly penetrate a woman with your finger instead of your penis then you are only guilty of sexual assault
* President Trump is a CONVICTED FELON - we don't let Felons take most jobs in America but we gave this felon control of our country, our military and our nuclear arsenalk

And I'd like to close by saying that I live in Fishers, Indiana.  

And I am not afraid of our President

I ask that you share this far and wide because President Trump IS NOT NORMAL AND AMERICA IS IN TROUBLE

My name is Scott Johnson and I am the State Organizer of Indiana 50501 

And we are the resistance
