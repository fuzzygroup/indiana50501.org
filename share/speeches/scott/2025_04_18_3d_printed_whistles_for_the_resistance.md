# Speech: 3D Printed Whistles For the Resistance

Here at Indiana 50501, we make Whistles. We make thousands of Whistles. 

[show plate]
[show bucket]

That bucket has over 2000 whistles in it

I will have at least 6 such buckets for the 4/19 protest

We aim to give away 10,000 plus whistles

But why do we make whistles?

Ever hear of the term The Bystander Effect?

That's when you see something bad happening:

Say ICE dragging away a woman on the streets of Boston

and you don't do anything because you think the next guy will do something

and he thinks that about you

You both become bystanders to something bad 

Now I firmly believe that the people who work for ICE are cowards

Kristi Gnome is a coward

Why?  Because real law enforcement wears an actual uniform and

carries a badge and they are members of the community

Now I know that interfering with a "OFFICER" doing his work is scary as hell

And I haven't done it myself

But, and this may be foolishly naive, I believe that if you shine a light on 

something it tends to go away

-or- IF YOU BLOW YOUR WHISTLE

I want to get to the point where if ANYONE EVER SEES ICE, THEY BLOW THEIR

WHISTLE.  I WANT THAT TO BE A THING

And in closing, I want to thank Sargeant Paul Vanek here in Indianapolis
â€¨He and his officers have kept our protestors safe at every protest so far

Paul Vanek doesn't wear a mask.  He doesn't kidnap people off the street

That is the job of Kristi Gnome and her jackbooted, masked thugs

Oh and if you are in the 3d printing business and you like the idea of what we 

do with whistles, we could use some more filament and some more printers
