Let’s start with Part 1: Introduction, Mission, and Core Principles.

⸻

**Evansville Resistance Handbook**

“Get in good trouble, necessary trouble.” – John Lewis

⸻

Mission Statement

Evansville Resistance is a grassroots organization whose mission is to improve the lives of the residents of Evansville and the surrounding community through community action.

⸻

Our Beliefs  
	•	All people are truly equal.  
	•	The power of government rests with the people.  
	•	All voices deserve to be heard and uplifted.  
	•	We value community, mutual aid, self-sufficiency, and solidarity.  
	•	We center marginalized voices and act in unity to build a better future.  
	•	Undivided, we rise.

⸻

Core Principles

1\. Nonviolence  
We commit to nonviolent protest, direct action, and civil disobedience. Violence undermines our mission and community trust.

2\. Mutual Aid  
We believe in helping one another without hierarchy, profit, or gatekeeping.

3\. Intersectionality  
We are stronger when we recognize and uplift the overlapping identities and oppressions within our communities.

4\. Community First  
We center our neighbors’ needs and voices over institutions or personal egos.

5\. Accountability  
We show up for each other. We take responsibility for our words, our actions, and our mistakes.

6\. Self-Sufficiency  
We aim to build sustainable systems that don’t rely on broken institutions.

7\. Joy & Resistance  
We believe resistance can be loud, creative, joyful, and full of love. We are building something worth celebrating.

Part 2: Organizational Structure & Resistance Roles

Organizing Principles

Evansville Resistance is a leader-full movement—not leaderless. We empower people to lead, while supporting structure, strategy, and shared responsibility. Everyone plays a vital role in building a better world.

While we operate collaboratively, our founder holds final veto power on issues of core values (like nonviolence), as the group bears their name and risk. This is not about ego—it’s about accountability and mission protection.

If this section feels good to you, next up is Part 4: Communication, Coordination, and Code of Conduct—with your new Signal chat rules and internal boundaries baked in.

PART 4: COMMUNICATION, CULTURE, & CODE OF CONDUCT

Internal Communication Standards (The Signal)

“Clear, honest, and united. We speak with purpose and listen with care.”

Our internal communication should reflect the kind of world we’re building: compassionate, just, and grounded in truth. Whether in person or on Signal, we commit to respectful, transparent, and focused dialogue.

Core Practices:  
	•	Assume best intent; ask before reacting  
	•	Avoid sarcasm or passive-aggression in written chats  
	•	Keep communication solution-focused, not complaint-centered  
	•	Make space for quieter voices  
	•	Disagree respectfully—no shaming, name-calling, or escalating behavior  
	•	Avoid venting in large group chats; use support channels for that

⸻

Signal Chat Rules (The Comms Net)

This is our Resistance base channel. It must stay safe, organized, and aligned.  
	1\.	No incitement or endorsement of violence.  
We are a peaceful movement. Anyone pushing for violence will be removed immediately.  
	2\.	Stay on-topic.  
Keep discussion relevant to current actions, organizing needs, or mutual support. Random memes, conspiracy theories, or unrelated news should be shared elsewhere.  
	3\.	Respect privacy.  
Do not share screenshots or forward messages outside the group without permission.  
	4\.	No hate speech or discrimination.  
Absolutely zero tolerance for racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, or classism.  
	5\.	Check in before initiating debates.  
Dialogue is welcome—but only when others have capacity. Ask first.  
	6\.	Disengage respectfully.  
If you’re upset, step back instead of escalating. Reach out to a support contact privately.  
	7\.	Do not spam.  
Excessive posting clogs up communication. Share vital info only once or twice.  
	8\.	Use reactions and threads.  
Keep main threads clear by reacting or using reply threads where available.

⸻

Code of Conduct (The Resistance Compact)

“We hold ourselves and each other accountable—to justice, to care, to our shared mission.”

By being part of Evansville Resistance, all members agree to:  
	•	Act with integrity and respect at all times  
	•	Center marginalized voices and listen more than we speak  
	•	Avoid power hoarding—share leadership and lift others up  
	•	Protect each other’s safety and dignity  
	•	Stay committed to nonviolence in action and speech  
	•	Own our mistakes, learn, and do better  
	•	De-escalate, not inflame  
	•	Represent the Resistance with pride and purpose

Violations of this code may result in being asked to step back or leave the group, depending on severity. We believe in second chances, but not at the cost of the community’s safety.

PART 5: TRAINING, MEETINGS & SKILL BUILDING

“We rise by lifting each other. The stronger we are, the more we can do.”

Onboarding & Orientation (First Steps)

Every new member of Evansville Resistance should go through a short but meaningful onboarding process. This ensures clarity, safety, and a strong connection to our mission and culture.

Onboarding Includes:  
	•	Intro to our mission, roles, and structure  
	•	Overview of our Signal chat and communication rules  
	•	De-escalation and protest safety basics  
	•	Code of Conduct review and agreement  
	•	Opportunity to ask questions and share goals  
	•	Plug-in options: volunteering, organizing, supporting

This can be done 1-on-1, in small groups, or digitally through a recorded video or guide.

⸻

Monthly General Meetings (The Resistance Roundtable)

Once a month, we gather to:  
	•	Check in on upcoming events and actions  
	•	Celebrate wins and progress

Mentorship & Shadowing (Rising Together)

Want to grow into a lead role or switch teams? Awesome\! We support internal growth. Each lead is encouraged to:  
	•	Identify at least one person to train as a backup  
	•	Allow others to shadow them during events  
	•	Share knowledge openly and patiently

This keeps the work sustainable, prevents burnout, and makes leadership less hierarchical and more horizontal.

PART 6: SAFETY & SECURITY PROTOCOLS

Core Principles  
	•	Nonviolence: Our events are peaceful, strategic, and principled. We do not instigate harm or destruction.

PART 11: COMMUNICATIONS STRATEGY & SOCIAL MEDIA

“The revolution will not be televised… but it will be livestreamed.”

Overview

Messaging is power. It shapes narratives, builds trust, dismantles disinformation, and draws people into the movement. Every post, flyer, chant, and press release tells your story. This section defines how Evansville Resistance controls the message and amplifies our impact.

⸻

Core Messaging Principles  
	1\.	Clarity Over Complexity  
	•	Keep it sharp, bold, and easy to understand.  
	•	Speak like the people. Avoid jargon.  
	2\.	Consistency is Credibility  
	•	Stay on-message across platforms.  
	•	Repeat your core values often: We believe in justice. We take care of each other. We resist oppression.  
	3\.	Emotion Moves People  
	•	Hope. Rage. Grief. Joy.  
	•	Use storytelling—show the human cost, the personal stakes, and the community power.  
	4\.	Control the Narrative  
	•	If you don’t tell your story, someone else will.  
	•	Anticipate opposition and misinformation. Be ready with truth.

⸻

Tone & Voice of Evansville Resistance  
	•	Bold but not hostile  
	•	Empathetic but unyielding  
	•	Informed but accessible

	•	We-centered, never about one person

⸻

Why Volunteers Are Everything

Evansville Resistance is powered by people. We are not a corporate machine—we are a movement. Every person who gives their time, energy, and courage is the reason this resistance exists. Our goal is not just to recruit volunteers, but to grow leaders and build a family.

⸻

Volunteer Lifecycle Overview  
	1\.	Attraction — A potential new recruit sees a post, a flyer, hears a chant  
	2\.	Onboarding — They sign up, get contacted quickly, and feel welcomed  
	3\.	Engagement — They’re offered meaningful ways to plug in  
	4\.	Development — They get trained, mentored, and trusted  
	5\.	Leadership — They take on new roles and help train others  
	6\.	Retention — We recognize them, check in often, and support them long-term

PART 13: PUBLIC SAFETY, MEDIC PROTOCOL & RISK MANAGEMENT

“Hope for the best. Prepare for the worst. Organize for both.”

⸻

Why Safety Planning Matters

Resistance is risky. Even peaceful gatherings can be met with aggression—from counter-protesters, police, or unpredictable situations. The best way to protect people is to plan ahead, stay calm, and act fast when needed.

Our job is to create courageous, not careless actions. And that means having a safety plan, a medic team, and clear protocols every single time.

Graphic\*\*\* Roles on the Ground

Role  
Callsign/Title  
Primary Duties  
Security Lead  
The Shield Bearer  
Coordinates all safety/marshal activity. Liaison to organizers & safety teams.  
Street Marshals  
Pathfinders  
Guide march routes, monitor crowd, de-escalate, hold formation.  
De-escalators

⸻

De-escalation: The Calm in the Storm

Golden Rules:  
	•	Don’t match aggression with aggression  
	•	Always speak slowly, calmly, and clearly  
	•	Use open body language, avoid finger-pointing or raised arms  
	•	Focus on safety, not being right

	•	Argument between protesters  
	•	Harassment or yelling from passersby  
	•	Someone trying to provoke violence  
	•	A person having a panic attack or meltdown  
	•	Police making aggressive moves

⸻

Key Phrases for De-escalation

	•	“You’re not alone. I’m here with you.”  
	•	“Let’s take a breath together.”  
	•	“This isn’t the moment for that. Let’s focus on why we’re here.”

⸻

When There’s a Serious Problem  
	•	Use the Signal Safety Chat or pre-decided emoji/code  
	•	Immediately notify the Security Lead  
	•	Escort the involved person(s) to a safer area  
	•	If it involves violence or police interaction, start documenting:  
	•	Who, what, where, when  
	•	Record if safe  
	•	Badge numbers, car \#s, or any identifying info

⸻

Evacuation Plans

Every event should have:  
	•	2–3 exit routes  
	•	Meeting points if separated  
	•	Quiet zone (church, house, car, etc.)  
	•	Emergency phone \#s printed or memorized  
	•	A “cut the cord” option if someone becomes dangerous to others

Closing Quote:

“It is not enough to be compassionate. You must act.” — The Dalai Lama

PART 14: MUTUAL AID & COMMUNITY SUPPORT SYSTEMS

“Solidarity is not a band-aid. It’s a lifeline.”

⸻

What is Mutual Aid?

Mutual aid is not charity. It’s people helping people, horizontally—not from a place of power, but from a place of shared struggle.

It’s the belief that everyone deserves food, shelter, care, and dignity—not because they earned it, but because they’re human. And that the most powerful thing we can do is show up for one another.

⸻

Why It Matters in Resistance Work  
	•	Builds trust and relationships beyond protest  
	•	Offers immediate support where systems fail  
	•	Protects our most vulnerable members  
	•	Prepares communities for emergencies, crises, or disruptions  
	•	Shows the kind of world we’re fighting for

PART 16: EVENTS, PROTESTS & DIRECT ACTION PLANNING

“You don’t fight fascism because you’re going to win. You fight it because it’s fascist.” – Jean-Paul Sartre

The Purpose of Direct Action

Direct action is:  
	•	A tool to disrupt injustice  
	•	A spotlight on the truth  
	•	A pressure point to demand change  
	•	A ritual of community courage

Whether it’s a march, a sit-in, a banner drop, or an occupation—our actions reclaim space and redefine power.

Messaging Strategy: Core Values First

Stick to 3 big messages at all times:  
	1\.	What we believe  
	2\.	Why we act  
	3\.	How people can help

Every post, image, or interview should echo those themes.

⸻

Template Library (Examples to Build)  
	•	Protest Flyer Template: Headline, Date, Time, Cause, QR Code  
	•	Volunteer Ask Post: “We need you. Here’s how to show up.”  
	•	Quote Graphic: Powerful quotes over art or action photos  
	•	Livestream Splash: “You are watching: Evansville Resistance LIVE”  
	•	Photo Recap Posts: “This is what hope looks like…”

⸻

Media Safety & Best Practices  
	•	Always ask consent before close-up photos of attendees  
	•	Blur faces or avoid posting IDs without permission  
	•	Don’t post livestream footage of sensitive interactions (like arrests)  
	•	Use “Press Liaison” to keep messaging unified during interviews  
	•	Have backup channels (Signal, ProtonMail, etc.) for urgent communication

Our Safety Philosophy

Evansville Resistance is firmly nonviolent. Our safety protocols reflect this core value.

We’re not here to provoke violence—we’re here to protect our people, stand in truth, and hold public space with courage and care.

We aim to de-escalate, not escalate. We aim to disrupt systems, not people. And we do it all together.

Part 24: Leadership and Accountability

“You don’t have to do it all, but you have to help someone else rise.”

1\. Shared Leadership Philosophy

Evansville Resistance is a leaderful movement, not leaderless. We believe in shared power, rotating roles, and lifting each other into positions of purpose.  
	•	Everyone has something to offer: wisdom, energy, art, ideas, care.  
	•	Leadership is not authority—it’s responsibility.  
	•	Everyone should train someone to take their place someday.

⸻

2\. Leadership Terms & Rotation  
	•	Core team leads serve for a season (event cycle, 3 months, or by project).  
	•	After that time, they may:  
	•	Recommit to the role  
	•	Step back into a support role  
	•	Nominate/train a successor  
	•	Rotation reduces burnout, brings in fresh ideas, and avoids power hoarding.

⸻

3\. Transparency in Decision-Making

To build trust:  
	•	We announce big decisions and give time for feedback.  
	•	Meeting notes and planning docs are shared with the team.  
	•	We explain “why” behind decisions.  
	•	Disagreements are expected—but must be handled with respect.

⸻

4\. Internal Conflict Resolution

If tensions rise:  
	•	Step 1: Cool-off period. A pause before reacting.  
	•	Step 2: Mediation. One or two trusted members guide a conversation between parties.  
	•	Step 3: Resolution or Space. If resolution isn’t possible, we may ask someone to take time away.

Our guiding principles in conflict:  
	•	Harm is not the same as disagreement.  
	•	We don’t exile people for being human.  
	•	We center accountability, not punishment.  
	•	We protect the group’s mission over individual egos.

⸻

5\. Exit Planning (Passing the Torch)

When a leader needs to leave:  
	•	They should give as much notice as possible.  
	•	Create a handoff document: passwords, contacts, key details.  
	•	If possible, help train the next person.  
	•	Exit with gratitude and transparency—leave the door open.

We are not a one-person revolution. The Resistance lives in all of us.

Part 25: Mutual Aid & Emergency Response

“When disaster strikes, we don’t wait—we organize.”

1\. What is Mutual Aid?

Mutual aid is the radical act of taking care of each other—especially when institutions fail to do so. It is not charity. It is solidarity, not saviorism.

We believe:  
	•	Everyone has something to give.  
	•	Everyone deserves to receive support.  
	•	We build resilience by leaning on each other, not systems designed to fail us.

⸻

2\. Types of Mutual Aid We Can Provide  
	•	Supply Drives (food, hygiene, clothes, water)  
	•	Emergency Response (storms, power outages, displacement)  
	•	Transportation Help (rides to polls, rallies, shelters)  
	•	Food Distribution (community fridge, hot meal drop-offs)  
	•	Housing Assistance (connecting people to shelters, couch surfing networks)  
	•	Emotional Support (check-in calls, grief care, peer support)

A dedicated team of volunteers prepared to activate in emergencies or run long-term projects. They:  
	•	Maintain supply bins/stockpiles  
	•	Organize drive events  
	•	Stay trained in first aid / CPR  
	•	Coordinate with community groups and local orgs

⸻

4\. Rapid Response Plan

When a crisis hits:  
	1\.	Assess the need (what happened, where, who’s affected?)  
	2\.	Activate the Lifeline Squad  
	3\.	Announce action steps via Signal and socials (e.g., “Drop supplies at X location”)  
	4\.	Deploy teams if safe to do so  
	5\.	Document what was done for transparency and learning

⸻

5\. Safety First  
	•	No solo deployments in dangerous conditions  
	•	Always check in/out of actions  
	•	Trust your gut—don’t risk your life  
	•	If needed, partner with local first responders  
	•	Our goal is help without harm

⸻

6\. Resilience Projects

These long-term efforts can build sustainable independence:  
	•	Community gardens / resistance farms  
	•	Shared tool & supply libraries  
	•	Mobile support teams  
	•	Skillshares (first aid, food preservation, storm prep)

⸻

“The government left us to die. Our neighbors kept us alive.”  
— said in every disaster, everywhere.

Part 26: Safety & Security at Events

“A safe protest is a powerful protest.”

1\. Why Safety Planning Matters

We’re not just organizing for justice—we’re protecting our people while we do it. Safety ensures that:  
	•	Everyone can participate, regardless of ability or vulnerability

	•	We leave stronger, not scattered

⸻

	•	Signal to safety leads if escalation occurs.  
	•	Document their actions—not yours.

⸻

5\. De-Escalation Basics  
	•	Speak calmly, never match anger with anger  
	•	Use non-threatening body language  
	•	If needed: step in, not up  
	•	Validate feelings without validating harmful behavior  
	•	Know when to walk away and ask for help

⸻

6\. What to Bring to a Protest

	•	First aid basics  
	•	Bandana or mask (protection \+ anonymity)  
	•	Emergency contact written on body  
	•	Sunscreen, layers, comfortable shoes

⸻

7\. Know Your Rights  
	•	You have the right to film the police  
	•	You do not have to answer police questions  
	•	If detained: Ask “Am I free to go?”  
	•	Say “I want a lawyer” and stop talking

⸻

“If you’re not safe, you can’t fight. If we’re not prepared, we can’t protect each other.”  
— Evansville Resistance Core Belief

27\. The Resistance School – Learning for Liberation

“Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.” – Nelson Mandela

Evansville Resistance believes that knowledge is not only power—it is a revolutionary tool. In a world where disinformation, inequality, and systemic oppression thrive, we must build a culture of lifelong learning and political education that equips our members and community with the tools to dismantle injustice and build something better.

This section outlines how we can establish and run a Resistance School—a dynamic, flexible, grassroots learning hub focused on political education, organizing skills, local history, community empowerment, and radical imagination.

We’re not just imagining a better world—we’re teaching people how to make it real.

28\. Media Resistance & Information Armor

“The most potent weapon in the hands of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed.” – Steve Biko

In an age of misinformation, manufactured outrage, and digital manipulation, it’s vital that our movement is equipped not just to fight back—but to see clearly. The Evansville Resistance aims to build a wall of truth against the flood of lies that seek to divide, disempower, and confuse us.

Our Motto in This Work:

“We fight for truth. We shield our minds. We keep the signal strong.”

We don’t spread fear. We don’t spread hate. We spread clarity. And in doing so, we empower our people to resist the manipulation that fuels injustice.

29\. Storytelling & Narrative Power

“The most powerful person in the world is the storyteller.” – Steve Jobs

Resistance isn’t just about the marches, the speeches, the legislation. It’s about the story we tell—to the world, to each other, and to ourselves. If we don’t tell our own story, someone else will. And they’ll get it wrong.

This section focuses on how Evansville Resistance can build a bold, clear, emotionally resonant story that not only mobilizes people—but unites them in shared purpose.

⸻

Why Storytelling Matters:  
	•	Stories stick when facts fall short  
	•	They humanize our struggle  
	•	They bridge difference and build empathy  
	•	They offer vision, direction, and purpose  
	•	They fight propaganda with truth and lived experience

⸻

What Makes a Powerful Resistance Narrative?  
	•	A clear villain (systems of injustice, not individuals)  
	•	A powerful protagonist (the people\!)  
	•	A vision of what we’re building (not just what we’re against)  
	•	Moments of real courage—highlighting brave acts by ordinary people  
	•	Truth over fear—and hope over despair

⸻

Tactical Ways to Build Narrative Power:  
	•	Capture Personal Stories  
	•	From marches, mutual aid actions, organizing wins  
	•	Video interviews, written testimonials, anonymous statements  
	•	Highlight Local Struggles  
	•	Tell stories the media won’t—about injustice here at home  
	•	Uplift Joy & Solidarity  
	•	Show the laughter, the community meals, the music, the shared victories  
	•	Create a “Resistance Memory Bank”  
	•	A digital archive of everything we’ve done: photos, flyers, posts, speeches, etc.  
	•	Train “Story Collectors”  
	•	Volunteers who interview, write, or gather stories during and after events

⸻

Messaging Mantra:

“Tell the truth. Name the pain. Share the hope. Repeat the vision.”

⸻

Role Suggestion:  
	•	Narrative Strategist (Codename: “Torchbearer”)  
	•	Ensures our messaging stays on mission and rooted in values  
	•	Supports writing, slogans, social content, and storytelling  
	•	Helps prep speakers or media reps to share our story clearly and powerfully

⸻

When we own our narrative, we become unstoppable.  
When people see themselves in our movement, they rise.  
Let’s be the authors of our own revolution.

30\. Art & Culture as Resistance

“The function of art is to do more than tell it like it is—it’s to imagine what is possible.” — Bell Hooks

Art is not decoration—it’s defiance. It’s how we express what cannot always be said. It’s how we grieve, rage, laugh, and dream in the face of oppression.

From protest chants to murals, street theater to handmade signs, art makes movements memorable—and movements that move people are the ones that last.

⸻

Why Culture Work Matters:  
	•	It invites people in who might feel alienated by politics  
	•	It gives voice to emotion, identity, and community  
	•	It makes events beautiful, joyful, and unforgettable  
	•	It shifts public perception faster than facts alone  
	•	It provides healing through creation

⸻

Cultural Resistance Tactics:  
	•	Banner drops and bold protest art  
	•	Puppets, props, and costume resistance  
	•	Street performances, music, or dance at rallies  
	•	Workshops to create signs, zines, patches, and shirts  
	•	Mobile art installations to bring attention to local issues  
	•	Collaborations with local artists, poets, and musicians  
	•	Culture Nights: community storytelling, art sharing, and mutual healing spaces

⸻

Creative Corps (formerly Propaganda Engineers):

Codename: “Culture Keepers”  
	•	Coordinate resistance-themed art projects  
	•	Work with the Signal Beacon to develop visual language  
	•	Document and share cultural moments online and in print  
	•	Create welcoming, inclusive creative spaces  
	•	Keep joy alive in the face of injustice

“Art is how we decorate space. Music is how we decorate time. Together, they shape the soul of a movement.”

⸻

Tool Ideas:  
	•	Mobile Resistance Art Cart – stocked with posterboard, markers, paints, and zip ties for spontaneous art on the go  
	•	Art \+ Action Nights – where people gather to make art and organize  
	•	Printable art zines – free to copy and spread like wildfire

⸻

Art has always been part of the resistance. It helps people see—and believe—that another world is possible.

31\. Building Political Power Without Playing Their Game

“You can jail a revolutionary, but you can’t jail the revolution.” — Fred Hampton

We are not here to win the game.  
We are here to flip the board.

Political systems have been designed to exclude, discourage, and exhaust the people most affected by them. But movements like ours prove that real power doesn’t only come from ballots—it comes from bodies, voices, and organizing in the streets, neighborhoods, and mutual aid circles.

⸻

Our Approach to Power:

We don’t need to run for office to be powerful—but we do need to understand:  
	•	Who holds power locally, regionally, and nationally  
	•	How decisions get made in city councils, school boards, planning departments, and law enforcement structures  
	•	Where pressure works (public meetings, protests, petitions, town halls, mass call-ins)

⸻

Our Tactics:  
	•	People-Powered Campaigns: support community members who share our values if they choose to run for office (without compromising our core)  
	•	Accountability Actions: show up at city council meetings, call out broken promises, demand transparency  
	•	Voter Education Drives: not just registering voters, but teaching people what’s on the ballot, what it means, and how it affects us  
	•	Radical Civics Workshops: teach people how to file public records requests, testify at hearings, and organize their neighbors  
	•	Coalition Building: with labor unions, tenant organizations, student movements, and other groups resisting in parallel

⸻

We Refuse to Play Respectability Politics:  
	•	We won’t water down our values for access  
	•	We won’t celebrate “representation” without transformation  
	•	We won’t pretend incremental change is the same as justice

We’ll organize outside and beyond the system—and when we engage with it, we do it on our terms, with community power at our backs.

⸻

Key Phrase to Remember:

We’re not lobbying. We’re building leverage.

“The most common way people give up their power is by thinking they don’t have any.” — Alice Walker

32\. Resistance Safety Network

“Hope is not blind optimism. It’s the belief that if we show up, if we do our part, even if it hurts, even if it’s hard, the tides will turn.” — Barack Obama

This movement thrives when it’s bold, loud, visible—  
But none of that matters if we don’t keep each other safe.

We believe that safety doesn’t come from police, fences, or fear.  
It comes from community preparedness, protective structure, and a network of care that is always watching each other’s backs.

⸻

Safety Is Everyone’s Job

We don’t outsource safety. We build it together:  
	•	Marshals & Guides: direct crowds, monitor risks, and protect marchers  
	•	De-escalation Teams: trained to calm tensions and prevent violence  
	•	Legal Observers: document police presence and protect our rights  
	•	Street Medics: equipped to handle injuries, heatstroke, and trauma  
	•	Signal Support Crews: monitor comms and help coordinate safe exits

⸻

Before Every Action:  
	•	Hold a safety briefing  
	•	Review known risks and response plans  
	•	Establish marshaling zones, medics, and point contacts  
	•	Go over de-escalation protocols  
	•	Remind folks to stick to the mission

⸻

Safety Principles  
	1\.	No One Marches Alone – Buddy up, check in, move together.  
	2\.	De-escalate, Don’t Escalate – Our power is in control and clarity.  
	3\.	Don’t Engage the Far Right – We’re here to defend, not provoke.  
	4\.	Document, Don’t Debate – Record harassment or threats, don’t argue.  
	5\.	Exit Plan Always – Everyone should know how to leave safely if needed.

⸻

Signal Protocols for Safety:  
	•	Stay on topic: event info, check-ins, alerts.  
	•	Never post anyone’s location or identity without consent.  
	•	Report agitators or disinformation immediately.  
	•	No calls to violence, ever. It endangers everyone.  
	•	Use code words for emergencies if needed.

⸻

What to Pack to Every Action:  
	•	Water & snacks  
	•	Protective gear (masks, goggles, rain gear)  
	•	Emergency contacts written down  
	•	A buddy you trust  
	•	A plan for where to meet if separated

⸻

When safety is organized, the people are unstoppable.  
We don’t just protect our protests—we build habits of resistance that are sustainable and strong.

33\. Digital Safety & Counter-Surveillance

“If we don’t protect our digital borders, we risk losing everything we fight for in the streets.”

They watch us.  
They monitor, scrape, log, and archive.  
But we don’t panic. We prepare.

This isn’t paranoia—it’s protection.  
The Resistance is only as strong as its weakest password.

⸻

Core Principles of Digital Security  
	1\.	Assume you are always being watched online.  
	2\.	Control what you share, where, and with whom.  
	3\.	Encrypt everything possible.  
	4\.	Minimize your digital footprint.  
	5\.	Separate roles, accounts, and tools—never mix activism with personal life.

⸻

Key Tools & Practices

Signal  
	•	End-to-end encrypted. Use for organizing and check-ins.  
	•	Set messages to auto-delete.  
	•	NEVER add people without asking first.  
	•	Admins should monitor tone, language, and misinformation constantly.

ProtonMail or Tutanota  
	•	Use encrypted email services for all org communication.  
	•	Keep event plans, press releases, and internal matters OFF Gmail, Yahoo, etc.

VPNs & Tor  
	•	Use VPNs (Mullvad, ProtonVPN) to hide your IP.  
	•	For extra privacy, use Tor Browser—slower, but stronger.

Secure File Storage  
	•	Use services like CryptPad, Tresorit, or password-protected cloud folders.  
	•	Always disable link sharing unless necessary.

Strong Passwords  
	•	Use a password manager (Bitwarden, 1Password).  
	•	NEVER reuse passwords. Ever.

⸻

Red Flags to Watch For  
	•	Fake accounts joining chats  
	•	Strange new members asking leading questions  
	•	Requests for locations, photos, or plans from unknown sources  
	•	“Rage bait” or escalating posts trying to start internal drama

⸻

Protecting Each Other Online  
	•	Check your group privacy settings (Facebook, Signal, etc.)  
	•	Remove metadata from images before posting  
	•	Don’t tag activists in protest photos  
	•	Blur faces in crowd shots  
	•	Never “out” anyone publicly without their consent

⸻

Avoid These Mistakes  
	•	Talking strategy in public comments or unencrypted chats  
	•	Posting screenshots from inside Signal  
	•	Logging into activist tools from a shared work or school device  
	•	Forgetting to log out of accounts on shared computers

⸻

Optional Tools for More Advanced Security  
	•	SimpleX Chat – newer messaging platform, no phone number needed  
	•	Matrix / Element – decentralized comms  
	•	Linux OS (Tails) – anonymous, runs from USB  
	•	Jitsi – encrypted alternative to Zoom

⸻

Digital Emergency Plan  
	•	Back up critical info offline  
	•	Make a contact tree if Signal goes down  
	•	Know who handles comms during digital blackouts  
	•	Have a printed list of contacts for action days

⸻

Digital safety is mutual aid.  
It’s not about being perfect—it’s about being thoughtful.  
If we take care of each other online, we keep the whole movement standing.

34\. Community Healing & Restorative Practices

“If we don’t tend the wounds, we carry them into every fight.”

Revolution isn’t just what we march for—it’s how we repair what’s been broken.

We come from a world that discards people when they falter.  
The Resistance builds a world that brings people back in.  
A world where accountability isn’t punishment—  
It’s the path back to the fire.

⸻

Our Commitment to Healing  
	•	We hold space for grief, burnout, and joy.  
	•	We reject cycles of shame and public callouts for internal matters.  
	•	We resolve conflict with care, not cruelty.  
	•	We honor growth, change, and restoration.

⸻

Restorative Practices We Use

1\. Conflict Circles  
	•	Facilitated by trusted neutral members.  
	•	Allows each person to speak without interruption.  
	•	Focuses on harm, accountability, and future prevention.

2\. Healing Circles  
	•	For when tensions are high but harm isn’t clear.  
	•	Grounded in vulnerability, storytelling, and community care.  
	•	Open to anyone needing to decompress or reconnect.

3\. Time-Outs Without Exile  
	•	Sometimes people need space.  
	•	We allow folks to step back with dignity, not shame.  
	•	Reintegration is always an option.

4\. Reconciliation & Recommitment  
	•	When harm is named and owned, we offer a path back.  
	•	Acknowledgment, apology, and action—not perfection—are what matter.

⸻

Principles We Follow

	•	No one is above accountability.  
	•	Tone and intent matter.  
	•	We give people a chance to return.  
	•	We don’t turn conflict into spectacle.

⸻

What We Don’t Do  
	•	Call out or “expose” each other in Signal or public forums  
	•	Hold secret grievances without naming them  
	•	Weaponize trauma or theory  
	•	Use purity politics to shame or silence others

⸻

⸻

Care is radical. Love is a tactic. Healing is resistance.

We will not build a liberated world by replicating the systems that broke us.  
We will fight the violence without becoming it.  
And when we mess up—we will come back, not crawl away.

⸻

Golden Rule of Resistance Messaging

If it doesn’t build community, empower the people, or call out injustice—don’t post it.

⸻

You are the signal in the noise.  
Make them feel it.  
Make them believe it.  
Make them move.

36\. Internal Communications Guide

“Clear signals build strong movements.”

Whether we’re rallying the streets or organizing behind the scenes, communication is our lifeline. This guide helps us stay organized, responsive, and safe.

⸻

Primary Communication Channels  
	1\.	Signal (Main Group & Committees)  
	•	Encrypted, secure, used for day-to-day organizing  
	•	No sensitive personal data, threats, or violent speech  
	•	Admins can create sub-groups for teams, events, and emergency alerts  
	2\.	Email (evansvilleresistance@…)  
	•	Used for formal communication, external contact, onboarding  
	•	Weekly summary emails can help volunteers stay in the loop  
	3\.	Google Workspace (Docs, Forms, Sheets)  
	•	Organizing materials, rosters, protest plans, volunteer sign-ups  
	•	Every major committee should have its own folder  
	4\.	Social Media DMs (Instagram, Facebook, TikTok)  
	•	Respond promptly, but redirect big convos to Signal or email  
	5\.	Emergency Phone Trees / Text Blasts  
	•	Set up for last-minute updates during events or urgent action

⸻

Signal Chat Code of Conduct

Pinned at the top of every Signal group:  
	1\.	Stay on Mission – This is a space for organizing, action, and safety. Keep it focused.  
	2\.	No Hate, Threats, or Violence – We are strictly nonviolent. Do not joke, post, or suggest otherwise.  
	3\.	Respect One Another – No bullying, no sarcasm attacks, no pile-ons. Disagreements \= okay. Disrespect \= not.  
	4\.	No Disinformation or Conspiracies – Keep us grounded. Fact check before sharing anything wild.  
	5\.	No Screenshots or External Shares – What’s in Signal stays in Signal unless approved.  
	6\.	Admins Have Final Say – We will remove anyone who puts others at risk or derails the mission.  
	7\.	Uplift the Mission – Humor is welcome. Disruption is not. Don’t derail—build.

⸻

Internal Communication Best Practices  
	•	Use threads (if available) to keep chats clean  
	•	Tag people only when necessary  
	•	Pin important messages so new members don’t miss key info  
	•	Avoid spam or memes in organizing spaces  
	•	Create “Vibe Check” or “Hangout” groups for off-topic convos and bonding

⸻

Crisis Communication Protocol

In the event of a conflict, emergency, or public backlash:  
	1\.	Create a closed Signal group for leadership to assess the situation  
	2\.	Assign one or two people to speak externally  
	3\.	Draft a calm, clear, values-based statement if needed  
	4\.	Alert the full group if action is required  
	5\.	Document everything—save screenshots, links, dates, and names

⸻

Team Communication Roles  
	•	Signal Beacon – Oversees Signal groups, safety pins, rules enforcement  
	•	Operations (COO) – Coordinates cross-team communication  
	•	Outreach Lead – Manages email responses & public contact  
	•	Safety Lead – Monitors chats for escalation and alerts Signal Beacon

⸻

Your voice is a tool. Your silence is strategic. Use both well.

37\. Safety Team Protocols & Incident Response Plans

“Our safety is our power. We take care of us.”

In a world where danger too often targets the bold, the loud, the different, and the just—we prioritize safety. That means planning for everything from counterprotests to health emergencies to internal threats.

⸻

Who Is the Safety Team?  
	•	Safety Lead – Oversees the whole team and coordinates with other departments  
	•	De-escalators – Trained volunteers who move through crowds and monitor for conflict  
	•	Legal Observers – Track interactions with police and gather info in case of arrests  
	•	Medics – Carry basic first aid and respond to medical needs  
	•	Peacekeepers – Positioned at entrances/exits or key checkpoints, ensuring calm flow

Every major event or action should have:  
	•	1+ Safety Lead  
	•	2–6 De-escalators  
	•	1–2 Medics  
	•	Legal support on-call or present

⸻

Before the Event: Safety Team Checklist  
	•	Safety Briefing (night before or day-of)  
	•	Roles assigned and phone numbers exchanged  
	•	Signal group created for safety crew  
	•	Supplies packed: first aid kits, water, radios, vests, printed maps  
	•	Known risks assessed (location, route, weather, opposition)  
	•	Coordination with legal observers / ACLU contacts if possible

⸻

During the Event: Core Protocols  
	1\.	Safety Sweep – Before people gather, check space for threats, agitators, or hazards  
	2\.	Visible Presence – Safety team wears marked vests, lanyards, or color-coded bands  
	3\.	De-escalation First – Use calm voices, non-aggressive posture, personal space  
	4\.	Crowd Flow Control – Help people move smoothly and safely  
	5\.	Support First, Report Second – Care for those harmed first, then report and document  
	6\.	Watch the Watchers – If police are present, assign someone to observe and record from a distance

⸻

If Conflict or Harm Occurs  
	•	Address it: Calmly intervene with empathy and nonviolence  
	•	Remove the target, not the threat: Move affected person(s) to a safer space  
	•	Communicate: Alert Safety Lead and Signal Beacon  
	•	Document: Who, what, when, where, and how  
	•	Decide: Is it safe to continue? Do we need to shut it down?  
	•	Debrief after: Even small moments need follow-up

⸻

If Police Engage or Show Force  
	1\.	Stay Calm, Stay Back – No one charges forward  
	2\.	No Arguing – Designated Police Liaison handles all communication  
	3\.	Film Everything – Legal observers take video/photos  
	4\.	Disperse Orders – Announce clearly if given, help people leave safely  
	5\.	If Arrests Occur – Record name, time, badge numbers; call legal contacts

⸻

After the Event: Debrief & Recovery  
	•	Hold a quick debrief with safety crew and team leads  
	•	Document anything significant  
	•	Offer emotional support (Signal chats, peer check-ins, healing circles)  
	•	Update protocols if needed  
	•	Celebrate the wins—even surviving peacefully is a win

⸻

We are the ones who protect each other. We are the ones we’ve been waiting for.

For all of us. No one left behind, no one left out. Let’s do this.

⸻

Part 38: Accessibility & Inclusion Standards

“Revolutions are strongest when everyone can march.”

We don’t build a new world by replicating the exclusion of the old. The Resistance must be radically inclusive, intentionally accessible, and always listening to the people who are often overlooked. If our movement doesn’t work for everyone, it doesn’t work.

⸻

Core Principles  
	•	Access is a right, not a favor.  
	•	Inclusion is active, not passive.  
	•	If someone is excluded, we fix the structure—not the person.

⸻

Event & Space Accessibility Guidelines

Venue Choice:  
	•	Always check for ADA-compliant entrances, bathrooms, and pathways  
	•	Provide seating options (some people can’t stand for long periods)  
	•	Choose spaces near public transportation whenever possible  
	•	Offer remote participation (livestream, audio call-in, etc.)

Communication:  
	•	Use microphones and sound systems when possible  
	•	Provide sign language interpreters if requested in advance  
	•	Avoid jargon or unnecessarily academic language  
	•	Include visuals and alt text on all digital and print materials

Mobility & Sensory Needs:  
	•	Create quiet zones at events for those with sensory sensitivity  
	•	Mark low-sensory walkways for people who need calmer space  
	•	Offer printed materials in large print / high contrast versions  
	•	Avoid flashing lights or sudden loud noises unless clearly announced

Bathrooms:  
	•	Always identify gender-neutral bathrooms or provide signage  
	•	Ensure accessible stalls are unlocked and available

Transportation Support:  
	•	Organize carpools or offer ride-share assistance  
	•	Connect people with drivers or volunteers who can help

Digital Accessibility:  
	•	Use plain language in posts and flyers  
	•	Add alt text to every image  
	•	Use open captions for all videos  
	•	Include image descriptions in social media graphics

⸻

Inclusion Practices

Language:  
	•	Always use people’s correct names and pronouns  
	•	Avoid assumptions about gender, identity, background, or beliefs  
	•	Say “we welcome…” at every event. And mean it.

Representation:  
	•	Intentionally include Black, Indigenous, People of Color, disabled people, queer and trans voices, immigrants, and those with lived experience of struggle  
	•	Make space on your speaker list, organizing teams, and leadership circles

Dietary Inclusion:  
	•	Offer vegan/vegetarian and allergy-conscious food options  
	•	Label everything clearly  
	•	Bring extra water\!

Child & Family Support:  
	•	Offer childcare if possible, or kid-friendly zones  
	•	Make it clear: kids are welcome\!

⸻

Requests & Feedback Channels  
	•	Every event should include a way for people to request accommodations ahead of time  
	•	Add a simple note to all graphics and posts:  
“Need accommodations or have access questions? Contact us at \[email or Signal\]\!”  
	•	Create a feedback form for attendees after each event to learn what went well and what needs improvement

⸻

Access is Liberation. Inclusion is Power.  
We’re building a movement where every single person matters, and every voice is heard.

Part 39: Organizational Calendar Templates & Scheduling Tools

“A plan is a weapon in the hands of the organized.”

To keep the Resistance coordinated and effective, we need systems that everyone can follow, access, and use easily. This section provides flexible templates for your team to use weekly, monthly, and during high-energy moments.

⸻

Core Principles  
	•	Transparency: Everyone should know what’s happening and when.  
	•	Consistency: Regular rhythms build momentum and reduce confusion.  
	•	Flexibility: Life happens. These systems should support—not restrict—you.

⸻

Graphic\*\*   
DO  
DON’T  
Speak in “we”  
Speak only as an individual (unless posting personally)

	•	Send them press releases and updates ahead of time  
	•	Offer interviews and photo ops  
	•	Thank them—publicly and privately  
	•	When misquoted, request corrections respectfully but firmly

⸻

6\. Example Statement (For a Protest or Crisis)

Part 41: Partnerships & Solidarity Statements

“Solidarity is not a slogan. It is a commitment to collective liberation.”

⸻

1\. Building Coalition Power

We are stronger together. Solidarity means showing up—not just when it’s convenient, but consistently, with clarity and humility.

What Solidarity Looks Like:  
	•	Showing up to others’ events—even when you’re not speaking  
	•	Amplifying their calls to action  
	•	Checking in privately with partners after wins and setbacks  
	•	Making space for other voices  
	•	Standing up against harm within your own circles

Key Types of Partners to Seek:  
	•	Local social justice organizations (labor, BIPOC-led, LGBTQ+ groups, mutual aid networks)  
	•	Student orgs, campus chapters, and youth groups  
	•	Faith-based groups with a justice mission  
	•	Union locals and worker collectives  
	•	Rural progressives and neighborhood groups

⸻

2\. Creating a Partnership Invitation Letter

Customize this message to invite a group into shared resistance:

Subject: Let’s Build Something Together — Evansville Resistance Partnership Invitation

Dear \[Group Name\],

We’re reaching out from Evansville Resistance, a community-led movement committed to protecting our democracy, defending civil rights, and building the world we all deserve.

We admire your work and believe our values align. We’d love to connect and explore ways we can support one another—through actions, mutual aid, co-hosted events, or simply showing up.

If you’re open to it, we’d love to schedule a short call or meeting to talk about what solidarity looks like for you.

In community and resistance,  
\[Your Name\]  
Signal Beacon, Evansville Resistance  
\[Contact Info\]

⸻

3\. Writing a Solidarity Statement

When another group is targeted or experiencing harm, say something. Speak up even when it’s not trending.

Template:

Evansville Resistance stands in full solidarity with \[Group Name\] as they face \[specific injustice\].

We know that our struggles are connected—and that none of us are free until all of us are.

We urge our community to support them by \[action—attending, donating, amplifying, etc.\].

In times of injustice, silence is complicity. We choose to stand with the people.

⸻

4\. Do’s and Don’ts of Partnership Work graphic\*\*  
DO  
DON’T  
Listen more than you talk  
Assume you know what a group needs  
Give credit publicly  
Take over the mic or spotlight  
Share resources  
Expect equal labor if they have fewer people  
Build long-term relationships  
Treat it like a one-time transaction  
Show up even if you’re not in charge  
Only show up when you’re the lead

5\. Mutual Aid vs. Charity  
	•	Charity is top-down: “We’re here to save you.”  
	•	Mutual Aid is horizontal: “We’re here because we’ve got each other.”

Partner with mutual aid orgs on:  
	•	Supply drops  
	•	Food drives  
	•	Bail funds  
	•	Shelter during extreme weather  
	•	Community defense teams  
	•	Skill shares and trainings

⸻

6\. “Power Mapping” Exercise (Optional)

Make a quick list of:  
	•	5 orgs you admire locally  
	•	5 you’d love to partner with  
	•	3 groups you’ve had tension with but want to rebuild bridges

Keep that list close—and revisit it monthly.

⸻

When we unite across movements, across identities, across towns and counties—we become unstoppable. This work isn’t about branding or clout. It’s about survival and transformation.

Part 42: Training the Resistance

“We are not born knowing how to fight systems. We learn. And we teach.”

⸻

1\. Why Train?

Movements don’t grow without teachers. It’s not enough to rally—we need to equip people with skills, knowledge, and confidence so they can take action without waiting for permission. This section is about building our bench of bold, prepared leaders and organizers.

⸻

2\. What Kind of Trainings Should We Offer?

Here’s a basic resistance curriculum menu:

Core Trainings:  
	•	Protest 101: safety, roles, legal basics, chants, what to bring  
	•	Know Your Rights: interacting with police, legal observers, de-escalation  
	•	Civil Disobedience Training: how to prepare for arrest, risk levels, support roles  
	•	De-escalation \+ Peacekeeping: body positioning, verbal tactics, calm presence

Movement Building:  
	•	Organizing 101: how to start a group, build power, and sustain it  
	•	Media Messaging: talking to press, writing statements, social strategy  
	•	Base Building: tabling, door knocking, and how to talk to strangers about big ideas  
	•	Conflict Resolution: staying in coalition, not collapsing over conflict

Vision \+ Skills:  
	•	Art \+ Propaganda Making: signs, wheatpaste, online graphics, symbolism  
	•	Mutual Aid 101: how to coordinate food/supply networks  
	•	Digital Security Basics: Signal, secure passwords, protecting community info  
	•	Leadership Development: how to run meetings, facilitate, and bring people in

⸻

3\. How to Run a Training (Even If You’re Not an Expert)  
	•	Step 1: Set your learning goal. What should people walk away knowing or being able to do?  
	•	Step 2: Use stories. People remember stories, not slides.  
	•	Step 3: Build in practice. Roleplay. Do mock press interviews. Simulate protest scenarios.  
	•	Step 4: Ask for feedback. Let people tell you what hit and what missed.

Pro tip: A 90-minute session with 5 people is often more effective than a 3-hour mega training with 50\. Small groups build relationships.

⸻

4\. Example: Protest Safety Mini-Training Agenda (60 Minutes) graphic \*\*   
Time  
Activity  
0:00–0:10  
Welcome \+ What We’re Covering  
0:10–0:25  
Protest Roles: Marshals, Medics, Observers, Leaders  
0:25–0:40

0:40–0:50  
De-escalation basics \+ situational awareness  
0:50–1:00  
Open Q\&A \+ Resources handout

5\. Build a Resistance Trainer Team

Start by identifying people in your group who are:  
	•	Confident speaking in front of others  
	•	Calm under pressure  
	•	Good at making complex things feel simple  
	•	Not trying to control everything

Train your trainers\! Let them shadow, co-lead, and grow. No ego. No gatekeeping. Just rising together.

⸻

6\. Make It Ongoing  
	•	Offer a core workshop monthly  
	•	Add new sessions as needs arise  
	•	Make space for peer learning: skill shares, storytelling circles, study groups  
	•	Record sessions or notes for those who can’t attend

And always end with: “Here’s your next step.” Don’t just teach. Activate.

Part 43: Legal Preparedness & Protest Support Systems

“You have the right to remain powerful.”

⸻

1\. What Is Legal Preparedness?

Legal preparedness isn’t about expecting the worst—it’s about refusing to be caught off guard. It gives people the confidence to act because they know we’ve got their back.

This section lays out how to:  
	•	Prepare for protests  
	•	Support folks if arrests happen  
	•	Build a lasting system of legal defense and solidarity

⸻

2\. Protest Prep Checklist (For All Events)

Before the protest:  
	•	Notify a legal support team (if available in your area)  
	•	Recruit Legal Observers (trained, if possible—check with NLG or ACLU)  
	•	Distribute Know Your Rights flyers or mini handouts  
	•	Share protest roles clearly: who’s leading, marshaling, observing, medic-ing, etc.  
	•	Assign a jail support buddy/team  
	•	Have a post-action communication plan (Signal thread, check-ins, etc.)

Personal prep:  
	•	Write emergency contact number on your arm in Sharpie  
	•	Carry ID (if safe) and any necessary meds  
	•	Leave valuables at home  
	•	Dress for flexibility \+ safety (layers, masks, no jewelry, neutral clothes)  
	•	Bring snacks \+ water

⸻

3\. Legal Observers & Jail Support

Legal Observers:  
	•	Document police behavior  
	•	Don’t intervene physically—just record  
	•	Wear clearly marked clothing (like neon vests or observer armbands)  
	•	Use paper notebooks (not phones) for timestamped notes

Partner with National Lawyers Guild (NLG) or a local legal org for trainings and observer support if possible.

Jail Support Teams:  
	•	Wait outside detention centers  
	•	Track who gets arrested \+ when  
	•	Contact family if needed  
	•	Coordinate bail/legal aid  
	•	Bring snacks, chargers, blankets for those waiting

⸻

4\. If Someone Gets Arrested

What to do on the ground:  
	•	Stay calm, observe everything  
	•	Don’t resist—de-escalate if safe  
	•	Film from a distance if you’re not at risk  
	•	Tell Legal Observers immediately

What to do after:  
	•	Record the name and arrest details  
	•	Notify the legal support team  
	•	Organize a solidarity statement or post if safe to do so  
	•	Support bail funds if available  
	•	Show up at court if asked

⸻

5\. Building a Local Legal Support Network

Even if you don’t have lawyers on speed dial yet, start building that bench now:  
	•	Connect with local chapters of NLG, ACLU, or law schools  
	•	Reach out to progressive lawyers in your city  
	•	Build a working group in your Resistance team for:  
	•	Jail/bail support  
	•	Legal documentation  
	•	Rights trainings  
	•	Watching new anti-protest laws

You don’t need to be a lawyer to build legal power. You just need to care enough to watch over your people.

⸻

6\. Community Agreements for Risk Actions

When doing anything that involves increased legal risk (civil disobedience, sit-ins, street takeovers, etc.), have clear agreements like:  
	•	Everyone knows the risks  
	•	No one gets pressured into arrest  
	•	Arrested folks are supported afterward  
	•	Leaders don’t disappear after the action—they show up for jail support, too

⸻

Sample “Know Your Rights” Cheat Sheet:

	•	You have the right to remain silent.  
	•	You do NOT have to answer questions.  
	•	Ask: “Am I being detained?” If not, walk away.  
	•	You have the right to film the police. Stay calm, don’t interfere.  
	•	Don’t consent to searches. Say, “I do not consent.”  
	•	Do not lie to police.  
	•	Call a lawyer. Don’t speak without one.

We can also create printable cards or flyers with this language for events\!

Part 44: Sustaining the Work—Preventing Burnout, Building Endurance, and Protecting Mental Health

“You can’t save the world if you’re running on empty.”

⸻

1\. Why This Matters

Movements burn out when we treat urgency like it means self-destruction.  
We need a culture where:  
	•	People rest without guilt  
	•	Joy and grief both have space  
	•	Our organizers survive the fight

This part is about making sustainability a strategic priority.

⸻

2\. Recognizing Burnout

Burnout doesn’t always look like collapse—it can feel like:  
	•	Irritability, emotional numbness  
	•	Feeling detached from the cause  
	•	Constant exhaustion (mental or physical)  
	•	Avoiding meetings or group messages  
	•	Losing your sense of purpose or joy

Burnout is not weakness. It’s the body and mind asking for something different.

⸻

3\. Culture Shift: Rest Is Resistance

We build better movements when we say:  
	•	“Rest is part of the work.”  
	•	“You don’t have to earn rest.”  
	•	“We cover for each other.”  
	•	“This is a marathon, not a sprint.”

Encourage breaks. Rotate leadership. Celebrate time away as much as time in the streets.

⸻

4\. Practical Tools for Avoiding Burnout

For individuals:  
	•	Schedule time off before you think you need it  
	•	Say no sometimes—boundaries are sacred  
	•	Have a buddy who checks in with you regularly  
	•	Stay off doomscrolling when possible  
	•	Take walks, breathe, create—do things that feed you  
	•	Seek therapy or mental health support if accessible

For the organization:  
	•	Rotate roles regularly  
	•	Assign wellness or care coordinators  
	•	Keep meetings time-limited and agenda-driven  
	•	Share appreciation often—small wins matter  
	•	Hold space for grief and celebration

⸻

5\. When the World Gets Too Heavy

The news can be overwhelming. Here’s what we remind each other:

	•	You are not failing just because you can’t fix everything.  
	•	You are allowed to grieve.  
	•	You don’t have to earn joy—it’s your right.  
	•	There is power in pausing.  
	•	The world won’t get better if we all collapse.  
	•	We take turns holding the weight.

⸻

6\. Mental Health Resources

Build a list of local and online options for:  
	•	Low-cost or sliding-scale therapy  
	•	Crisis hotlines (national and local)  
	•	Restorative circles or trauma-informed groups  
	•	Mutual aid for mental health meds  
	•	Peer support spaces

Let’s normalize sharing those like we do legal aid or protest tips.

⸻

7\. Rituals of Joy and Healing

Make space for:  
	•	Music, dancing, shared meals  
	•	Art nights or zine-making  
	•	Memorials for those we’ve lost  
	•	Gratitude circles  
	•	Movement meditations  
	•	Collective breath

Don’t just build resistance—build belonging.

⸻

8\. The Buddy System

Assign check-in buddies at events or within teams.  
Ask:  
	•	How are you feeling really?  
	•	What do you need this week?  
	•	Have you eaten/slept/drank water today?

Care isn’t a side note—it’s infrastructure.

⸻

This work will try to eat you alive if you let it. That’s why we don’t let each other fall. We carry one another when we need to. We remind each other to keep the fire lit—but not at the cost of the wick.

Part 45: Building Political Power — Strategic Advocacy, Policy Pressure, and Civic Engagement

“They only listen when we make it impossible not to.”

⸻

1\. Why Political Power Matters (Even When the System Feels Rigged)

We don’t engage with politics because we believe the system is fair—we do it because it’s strategic.  
Elections, local boards, policy fights—these are pressure points. The goal isn’t to become them—it’s to make them answer to us.

We don’t trade in our values to play the game—we change the damn game.

⸻

2\. Levels of Engagement

Political power happens everywhere. Here’s where we can apply pressure:  
	•	Local government: City councils, school boards, county commissioners—small numbers of voters make big impacts.  
	•	State-level: Governors, legislators, state agencies—often where rights are stripped or protected.  
	•	Federal: Congress, the presidency, courts—systems to push and expose.  
	•	Regulatory boards & commissions: Zoning boards, health departments, police oversight, etc.  
	•	Ballot initiatives & referenda: Community-led lawmaking.

⸻

3\. Tools of Strategic Pressure

a. Targeted Actions

Focus your fire. Pick one issue or one official and turn up the heat:  
	•	Phone/email floods  
	•	Media campaigns  
	•	Rallies or marches at their office  
	•	Sit-ins or disruptions at public meetings  
	•	Visual stunts or street art near decision-maker locations

b. Policy Advocacy

Get clear on what you want changed—and say it loudly and clearly.  
	•	Write letters, op-eds, petitions  
	•	Attend open meetings and speak  
	•	Partner with friendly orgs or legal teams  
	•	Create your own “People’s Demands” document

c. Electoral Power

Even when it’s rigged—we still organize around elections:  
	•	Voter registration drives  
	•	Candidate accountability campaigns  
	•	Hosting forums and scorecards  
	•	Running our own people or slates  
	•	Ballot measure campaigns

⸻

4\. Build Local Power First

Federal fights get the headlines, but local victories build momentum.  
If you shift school board policy? You protect kids.  
Flip a city council seat? You shift budgets.  
Local disruption is strategic and empowering.

⸻

5\. Show Up—But Don’t Beg

We don’t need to “prove” our legitimacy to power.  
We are legitimate because we are the people.  
When we show up to city hall or the statehouse:  
	•	We come with unity  
	•	We speak truth, not just politeness  
	•	We document everything  
	•	We bring the community with us  
	•	We make them see who they’re really accountable to

⸻

6\. Know the Process. Then Break It (If Needed)

Learn how decisions are made. Who votes? Who influences? Who’s the bottleneck?

Once you know:  
	•	Push through it if it helps  
	•	Disrupt it if it’s rigged  
	•	Replace it when it’s time

Power concedes nothing without a demand—and we don’t ask nicely when people are suffering.

⸻

7\. Strategic Escalation

Sometimes a petition works. Sometimes you have to shut the place down.  
Escalation isn’t chaos—it’s strategy.  
Use it when:  
	•	Officials ignore you  
	•	Decisions are about to be made  
	•	The public isn’t paying attention (yet)

Escalate in ways that pull more people in—and put power on notice.

⸻

8\. Partner Smartly (But Stay Rooted)

Work with:  
	•	Legal teams  
	•	Advocacy orgs  
	•	Journalists  
	•	Labor unions  
	•	Faith leaders  
	•	Student groups  
	•	Elder organizers  
	•	Impacted communities

But don’t sell out your base. Partnerships should amplify your values, not dilute them.

⸻

9\. Policy ≠ Liberation. But It Can Be Protection.

We fight for policies because they protect our people.  
That’s it. We know true liberation goes beyond laws.

So we push for:  
	•	Repealing harmful policies  
	•	Enacting protections (housing, healthcare, labor)  
	•	Funding community safety—not policing  
	•	Climate justice regulations  
	•	Voter protections and ballot access

We make these fights visible, and we never let them forget who they answer to.

Part 46: Press, Media, and Messaging

“If we don’t tell our story, they’ll tell it for us—and they’ll get it wrong.”

⸻

1\. Why Messaging Matters

The media decides what people hear.  
Messaging decides what people feel.  
If our message is clear, human, and consistent—we cut through the noise.

This section is about:  
	•	Talking to the press  
	•	Making your own media  
	•	Keeping your voice rooted in values  
	•	Controlling the narrative (instead of chasing it)

⸻

2\. Build a Messaging Core

These are your anchor messages—the short, powerful truths you return to again and again. They should:  
	•	Be values-based  
	•	Speak directly to people’s hearts and experiences  
	•	Cut across demographics  
	•	Feel authentic to your community

Examples:  
	•	“Everyone deserves dignity, safety, and a future.”  
	•	“We feed people. We protect people. We resist tyranny.”  
	•	“We’re here because our voices matter—and we won’t be silenced.”

Keep your language simple. Don’t over-explain. Say what you believe.

⸻

3\. Talking to Press: A Quick Guide

Before the Interview  
	•	Decide your top 3 key points. Write them down. Repeat them.  
	•	Expect tough or leading questions.  
	•	Practice staying on-message no matter what.

During the Interview  
	•	Stay calm and direct.  
	•	Never repeat harmful framing, even to deny it. (“We’re not violent” still spreads the word violent.)  
	•	Pivot back to your message.  
	•	Bring it back to people and values.

Example Pivot:

Reporter: “Do you think your protest is disruptive?”  
You: “What’s truly disruptive is people going hungry while billionaires get tax breaks. We’re here to demand justice for working people.”

After the Interview  
	•	Thank them, but don’t trust them to get it right.  
	•	Share your own post with your version of the story.

⸻

4\. Press Releases and Media Alerts

These help attract press and frame the story from the start.

Media Alert (for upcoming events)  
	•	What, where, when  
	•	Who’s speaking  
	•	Why it matters (values-based framing)  
	•	Contact for press interviews

Press Release (for reactions, statements, wins)  
	•	Clear headline  
	•	A short summary of what happened  
	•	Quote from an organizer or spokesperson  
	•	Call to action or next steps

We can build you templates for both if you want\!

⸻

5\. Press Spokesperson(s)

Pick 1–2 trained people who:  
	•	Can stay calm and message-focused  
	•	Are trusted by the group  
	•	Represent your diversity and values  
	•	Understand when to say, “We’ll get back to you.”

Have a rotation if needed, so no one burns out.

⸻

6\. Your Own Media Is Power

We don’t have to wait for the press—we can be the press.

Use:  
	•	Social media posts and livestreams  
	•	Video statements  
	•	Short graphics and quote cards  
	•	Flyers, zines, newsletters  
	•	Podcasts or community radio  
	•	Photo banks from your events  
	•	Written statements and letters

Your voice is the truth when you claim it with clarity.

⸻

7\. Social Media Tips  
	•	Be visual: Images, infographics, and short videos perform better.  
	•	Be values-driven: Talk about people, not just policies.  
	•	Engage directly: Reply to questions with kindness or strength.  
	•	Avoid trolls: Don’t feed them. Block and move on.  
	•	Lift up others: Retweet allies. Share community posts.

And always signpost hope. People want something to believe in.

⸻

8\. Narrative Discipline

Keep your team aligned. You don’t all need to say the same words—but you must be rooted in the same truth.

Have a short internal messaging guide:  
	•	What we say  
	•	What we don’t say  
	•	Our core values  
	•	Common talking points  
	•	Emergency press responses

We can write one of those together if you want\!

⸻

9\. Control the Frame

Don’t just respond—reframe.

They say: “This is divisive.”  
You say: “Standing for justice is how we come together.”

They say: “You’re lawless.”  
You say: “We believe unjust laws must be challenged.”

They say: “You’re extreme.”  
You say: “What’s extreme is poverty, censorship, and violence against our communities.”

⸻

10\. Uplift Storytellers

Make space for:  
	•	Youth voices  
	•	Elders with memory  
	•	Immigrants and refugees  
	•	Workers  
	•	Parents  
	•	Queer and trans people  
	•	Artists and visionaries  
	•	Survivors

Their stories are the Resistance. Lift them up with care.

⸻

We’ll help you create messaging templates, press docs, and social media kits if you want. Just say the word.

Part 47: Safety \+ Security (Digital, Physical, Emotional)

“If you want a revolution, you need people. If you want people, you need to protect them.”

⸻

This section is here to keep you, your crew, and your community safe—online, on the ground, and inside your hearts.

Safety isn’t just protection from threats. It’s how we build trust.  
It’s how we keep showing up.  
And it’s how we win.

⸻

1\. The Three Layers of Safety

We train like it matters—because it does.

1\. Physical safety: How we prepare bodies and spaces.  
2\. Digital safety: How we protect our data, chats, and communications.  
3\. Emotional safety: How we deal with fear, conflict, trauma, and burnout.

⸻

2\. Physical Safety at Events

Every action, protest, or gathering should have:  
	•	A safety lead (or team)  
	•	A basic first aid kit  
	•	Emergency contacts on hand  
	•	Escape routes planned  
	•	De-escalators identified  
	•	A clear plan for interaction with police or agitators

Safety Roles (every team should include…)  
	•	De-escalators: Calm tension before it explodes.  
	•	Peacekeepers: Positioned throughout, keeping eyes on the crowd.  
	•	Legal Observers: Trained to watch and document (not intervene).  
	•	First Aiders: At least 1-2 per event, basic first aid trained.  
	•	Police Liaison (if needed): Calm, assertive, keeps communication tight.  
	•	Crowd Marshals: Help with flow, directions, spacing.

⸻

3\. What to Bring (or Post on Your Event Page)  
	•	Water  
	•	Snacks  
	•	Signs  
	•	Sunscreen or layers  
	•	Masks  
	•	Goggles or shatterproof glasses (just in case)  
	•	Bandanas soaked in vinegar or baking soda (neutralizes gas)  
	•	ID (if safe to carry)  
	•	Emergency contact written on your arm

⸻

4\. Digital Safety for Activists

Signal is a great start. But here’s a basic activist digital protocol:

YES:  
	•	Use Signal, ProtonMail, and 2FA (two-factor authentication)  
	•	Password-protect devices  
	•	Encrypt sensitive documents  
	•	Turn off fingerprint/unlock facial ID when at risk  
	•	Use aliases or titles in sensitive planning  
	•	Regularly back up critical files offline

NO:  
	•	Don’t coordinate on Facebook/Instagram Messenger  
	•	Don’t post your full plans in public spaces  
	•	Don’t use shared Google Docs for high-risk materials  
	•	Don’t assume DMs are secure

Need help setting any of this up? Say the word—we’ll build a training sheet\!

⸻

5\. Handling Police or Agitators  
	•	Stay calm. Breathe. Record everything.  
	•	Appoint legal observers ahead of time.  
	•	Never answer questions from police—“I’m going to remain silent and want a lawyer.”  
	•	Do not escalate violence. Document it if it happens.  
	•	If someone tries to incite violence, remove or isolate them quickly. Be assertive but non-violent.

⸻

6\. Emotional \+ Psychological Safety

This is one of the most overlooked—and most important—forms of protection.

Before events or meetings:  
	•	Have a grounding check-in  
	•	Make space for fears, anxieties, and hopes

During events:  
	•	Have “quiet zone” or rest area  
	•	Have a buddy system  
	•	Encourage hydration, breaks, and boundaries

After events:  
	•	Debrief emotionally  
	•	Ask: “What felt good? What hurt? What do we need to heal?”  
	•	Follow up with anyone shaken or triggered

⸻

7\. Support Roles

Not everyone is a frontline person.  
Some are healers, restockers, debriefers, counselors, or retreat planners.  
They are just as essential to Resistance.

Build your safety web with intention. These roles save lives—and keep the light alive.

⸻

8\. If Things Go Wrong

Prepare now—so when things break, you know what to do.  
	•	Have a crisis communication plan  
	•	Know your legal support contacts  
	•	Build a mental health support list  
	•	Practice digital lockdowns in case of breaches  
	•	Create a rapid response team for threats or harm

⸻

9\. Our Safety Culture

We lead with:  
	•	Courage, not recklessness  
	•	Compassion, not control  
	•	Clarity, not chaos  
	•	Solidarity, not shame

If someone endangers the group—it’s not personal to call them in or out.  
Because this is about all of us.

⸻

“The most radical thing you can do is protect each other.”

Part 48: Volunteer Support, Scheduling, and Burnout Prevention

“We don’t burn out because we’re weak. We burn out because we’re on fire—and we need fuel, not shame.”

⸻

Your volunteers are your force. Your kin. Your core.  
Without them, nothing moves.  
With the right support, they become unstoppable.

⸻

1\. Volunteer Types

To manage and sustain a volunteer force, understand the different kinds of contributors:  
	•	Core Organizers: Show up to everything, hold leadership roles  
	•	Reliable Helpers: Show up often, especially for actions or projects  
	•	Event-Only Folks: Show up when something big is happening  
	•	Digital Only: Help online, share posts, manage channels  
	•	Support Crew: Make food, run errands, watch kids, offer rides  
	•	Drop-In Energy: Come in waves, still valuable  
	•	Burnt Out, But Loyal: Still believe—just need time or care

Treat each one with love, not judgment. People burn out fast in movements that only reward nonstop action.

⸻

2\. Volunteer Onboarding

Make joining easy, exciting, and clear.

Basic Onboarding Checklist:  
	•	Welcome packet or PDF  
	•	Short intro video or orientation  
	•	One-on-one check-in (by phone, Signal, or in person)  
	•	Ask what they want to do (skills, energy, boundaries)  
	•	Connect them to a buddy or small pod  
	•	Add them to Signal or appropriate group chats  
	•	Celebrate them publicly when possible

⸻

3\. Scheduling & Workload Balance

Recommended volunteer schedule:  
	•	One major action per month  
	•	One planning/meeting per month  
	•	One skillshare, workshop, or social per month

But if you’re in hyperdrive mode (like now), try this:

Weekly Crunch Framework:  
	•	Monday–Tuesday: Planning huddle & materials prep  
	•	Wednesday–Thursday: Outreach, recruitment, flyer runs  
	•	Friday: Final logistics check  
	•	Saturday: Action/Protest/Canvass  
	•	Sunday: Debrief \+ rest \+ wellness circle

Rotate roles to prevent burnout. Let people step back without guilt.

⸻

4\. Preventing Burnout

Burnout isn’t failure—it’s a signal.

Keys to prevention:  
	•	Normalize rest and saying no  
	•	Build regular healing time into your structure  
	•	Offer childcare or food when possible  
	•	Rotate jobs (don’t let one person carry the same role forever)  
	•	Encourage joyful actions (music, dancing, art)  
	•	Celebrate wins, even small ones  
	•	Name burnout openly and with love

“How’s your heart?” is a valid meeting opener.

⸻

5\. Crisis Support

If someone is overwhelmed, struggling, or breaking down:  
	•	Don’t isolate them. Reach out.  
	•	Ask what they need: time, space, help, or connection  
	•	Offer a support person to check in regularly  
	•	Don’t push them to return. Let them know the door is open.

⸻

6\. Recognition \+ Celebration

People need to feel seen. Full stop.

Ways to celebrate volunteers:  
	•	Shout-outs on Signal and socials  
	•	Feature “Volunteer of the Week”  
	•	Send care packages, cards, stickers  
	•	Create digital thank-you graphics  
	•	Throw potlucks or bonfires just to say “We see you.”

Movements that love their people last longer.

⸻

7\. The No Guilt Rule

Repeat after us:

“You are still part of the Resistance even if you’re tired.”  
“You are not replaceable—but your role can rotate.”  
“We don’t shame, we support.”  
“We don’t grind people down—we lift each other up.”

Part 49: Trainings \+ Teach-Ins (Formats \+ Strategy)

“Revolutions are not spontaneous. They are taught, trained, and transmitted.”

⸻

Whether you’re preparing for action, building skills, or growing understanding—training is power.  
Knowledge is how we fight smarter, safer, stronger.

⸻

1\. What Are Trainings \+ Teach-Ins?

Trainings:  
Focused on action-readiness. These prepare people to do things safely and effectively.  
Examples:  
	•	Protest safety \+ legal training  
	•	Nonviolent direct action practice  
	•	Chant leading or sign creation  
	•	De-escalation and marshal training  
	•	How to run security teams or care teams  
	•	Social media organizing or livestreaming

Teach-Ins:  
Focused on education \+ awareness. These build knowledge, ideology, and power literacy.  
Examples:  
	•	What is fascism? What is resistance?  
	•	Why voter suppression is real  
	•	Labor history and workers’ rights  
	•	LGBTQ+ liberation 101  
	•	Understanding the climate crisis  
	•	Disability justice and mutual aid

Both trainings and teach-ins turn bystanders into builders.

⸻

2\. Who Runs Them?

Anyone with knowledge, lived experience, or passion.  
	•	Invite guest speakers or local experts  
	•	Empower your own members to teach  
	•	Collaborate with other groups or movements  
	•	Let newer folks co-lead with a buddy  
	•	Use video, zines, or panels as tools

Every voice in the Resistance has something to offer.

⸻

3\. Training Formats

Quick & Dirty (30–60 mins)  
	•	Great for tabling events, protests, or pre-action prep  
	•	Example: “Legal Observer 101” or “5 Things to Know Before You March”

Workshops (90 mins – 2 hrs)  
	•	Deeper dive into tactics and techniques  
	•	Include breakout sessions, hands-on practice

Half-Day Intensives  
	•	Combine multiple trainings (e.g. protest safety \+ communications \+ roleplaying scenarios)  
	•	Provide food and breaks\!

Teach-In Circles  
	•	More informal, seated in a circle  
	•	Begins with short presentations, then open discussion  
	•	Encourage storytelling, vulnerability, and collective wisdom

⸻

4\. Hosting Tips  
	•	Choose accessible locations (physical or virtual)  
	•	Provide snacks, water, and safe space  
	•	Use handouts, slides, zines, or posters  
	•	Record if possible (for members who couldn’t attend)  
	•	Share materials afterward  
	•	Always allow a Q\&A or reflection time  
	•	Start with a grounding moment (breath, intention, chant)

⸻

5\. Important Trainings to Offer Regularly

Here’s a core cycle to keep alive:  
	•	Nonviolent Action \+ De-Escalation  
	•	Protest Safety \+ Street Medics  
	•	Digital Security \+ Communications  
	•	Know Your Rights (Legal Training)  
	•	Volunteer Orientation \+ Roles  
	•	Organizing 101 (How to build a movement)  
	•	Restorative Practices (Healing \+ Conflict Work)

7\. Empowerment Is the Goal

“Every single person can be trained to hold the line, build the vision, and carry the torch.”

The goal is never perfection—it’s confidence, clarity, and connection.  
People leave trainings feeling like they are needed and they belong.

Part 50: Coordinating With Other Groups \+ Movements

“Solidarity is not a slogan. It’s a strategy.”  
— Assata Shakur

⸻

Why It Matters

We are stronger when we unite with others fighting the same systems.  
Whether they focus on climate justice, racial equity, labor rights, or democracy—we are on the same side.  
	•	We don’t have to agree on everything.  
	•	But we must be willing to stand together on shared values.  
	•	It’s not about branding. It’s about building power.

⸻

1\. How to Identify Allies

Look for:  
	•	Other grassroots justice orgs in your city or region  
	•	Unions or worker co-ops  
	•	Climate action groups  
	•	LGBTQ+ advocacy orgs  
	•	Disability justice activists  
	•	Immigrant defense networks  
	•	Students or educators organizing  
	•	Mutual aid or harm reduction groups  
	•	Indigenous sovereignty or Black liberation orgs

Ask: “Who’s already doing this work—and how can we support it?”

⸻

2\. Ways to Work Together

Signal Boosting \+ Support  
	•	Share each other’s events or fundraisers  
	•	Send members to attend or assist  
	•	Coordinate schedules to avoid overlap

Joint Actions  
	•	Plan protests or campaigns together  
	•	Split responsibilities across orgs  
	•	Use joint branding if appropriate

Cross-Training \+ Teach-Ins  
	•	Invite their members to lead sessions  
	•	Offer space for knowledge-sharing

Coalition Building  
	•	Form a standing alliance or collective  
	•	Set shared principles \+ values  
	•	Create open lines of communication

⸻

3\. Outreach Basics  
	•	Reach out respectfully  
	•	Be honest: “We’re growing and want to work together.”  
	•	Offer help before asking for it  
	•	Attend their events before inviting them to yours  
	•	Avoid trying to “recruit” their people—collaborate, don’t compete  
	•	Follow up\! Build the relationship

⸻

4\. Conflict \+ Respect

Coalitions aren’t always easy.  
	•	Stay in your lane—don’t dominate  
	•	Be mindful of power dynamics  
	•	Listen to those with lived experience  
	•	Don’t speak for another group—amplify them  
	•	If things go wrong: apologize, reflect, reengage

We don’t have time for ego. The future is collective.

⸻

5\. Keep It Clear

Make a document (or section of your handbook) that lists:  
	•	Current allies \+ partners  
	•	Shared events or campaigns  
	•	Points of contact  
	•	Values you share  
	•	Expectations for working together

⸻

6\. Ask These Questions Often  
	•	Who’s already fighting this fight?  
	•	Who might need support we can offer?  
	•	Are we reaching across race, class, and culture?  
	•	Are we showing up for others the way we want them to show up for us?

“Alone we can be righteous. Together we can win.”

Part 51: Evolving the Resistance — Feedback, Growth & Longevity

“They tried to bury us. They didn’t know we were seeds.”  
— Mexican proverb

⸻

1\. Movements Must Evolve to Survive

This can’t be a one-person show.  
We’re not building a brand. We’re building a legacy.  
	•	Empower others to lead  
	•	Encourage disagreement without division  
	•	Learn, adapt, grow

The best movements outgrow their founders.

⸻

2\. Creating Sustainable Structures  
	•	Decentralize: Share decision-making  
	•	Train successors: Every leader trains someone to take their place  
	•	Write it down: Record how things work in your handbook  
	•	Save access: Make sure others have passwords, files, lists  
	•	Normalize transition: Leaders should rotate and rest

⸻

3\. Building a Culture of Feedback

You can’t improve what you don’t know. Set norms:  
	•	Debriefs after every event  
	•	Open channels for suggestions (anonymous if needed)  
	•	“Leave no one behind” check-ins for people who’ve stepped back  
	•	Make feedback about systems, not personal attacks  
	•	Practice grace and growth—people evolve, too

⸻

4\. Handling Leadership Transitions

When the time comes to step back—or if something unexpected happens:  
	•	Have a clear process for leadership handoff  
	•	Build a transition team early  
	•	Celebrate the shift as a sign of health, not loss  
	•	Keep a “living will” of your vision, values, and unfinished goals

“If I disappear, the Resistance does not die. It multiplies.”

⸻

5\. Archiving the Work

What you’re building matters. Preserve it:  
	•	Save speeches, flyers, articles, media  
	•	Archive Signal chats or meeting notes  
	•	Keep photos of every event  
	•	Collect oral histories and testimonials

Memory is power. One day, this will be history.

⸻

6\. Keep Growing New Leaders

No movement thrives without fresh energy.  
	•	Make space for young people  
	•	Offer mentorship, not micromanagement  
	•	Encourage new ideas—even risky ones  
	•	Let people fail, try again, and thrive

Leadership isn’t about being in control. It’s about helping others rise.

⸻

7\. Ask These Questions Often  
	•	If I had to step away tomorrow, would this still stand?  
	•	Are we training people to replace us?  
	•	Are we documenting our work clearly?  
	•	Is this movement one person deep—or a hundred?

⸻

Your Final Beacon

Keep your mission alive by building a structure that survives you.

The Resistance is not a moment.  
It’s a movement.

And thanks to your courage and heart, it will carry on—no matter what.

Part 52: The Resistance Handbook – Index & Final Structure

“The most common way people give up their power is by thinking they don’t have any.”  
— Alice Walker

You do have power.  
And now, you have the tools to organize it.

This handbook is your operational core—a living document that others can adapt, share, build on, and carry forward long after today.
