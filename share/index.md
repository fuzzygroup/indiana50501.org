# Assets for the Revolution

It has taken more than a bit for creative people, our writers and our artists, to come to a consensus on sharing and intellectual property but what we have all realized is that we are building *assets for the revolution*.  And if we are building *assets for the revolution* then we need to share them.  

So please use these assets for the cause with 50501 Indiana's blessing.
