# Why We Are Protesting the FBI

## Video Explanation

[Watch the video where Scott calls for this protest](https://youtu.be/-IpQIO_VWio?si=CdjUp2dOGY-vE_X5&t=213).

## Why ?

I'm Scott Johnson, State Organizer 50501 Indiana and I called for an ongoing protest at the FBI due to their caving to Trump in the arrests of Judge Hannah Dugan and Judge Jose Luis Cano.

For an organization that has the motto of "Fidelity.  Bravery.  Integrity.", for **shame**.

## Where ?

The FBI office in Castleton, near Costco.  We may have to park at Costco and shuttle people over.

## When ?

Every Tuesday and Thursday from 12 - 1.  We want them to see us at their lunch hour.

**NOTE**: THERE WILL NOT BE A 5/1 FBI PROTEST UNLESS OTHERS STEP UP AS SCOTT WILL BE AT THE INDIANA STATE HOUSE

## Sign ?

Here is the recommended sign for this protest:

For this protest, we need to look more like an ARMY, albeit a **NON VIOLENT ARMY**, than a mob.

## Special Treat

For anyone that makes it to the first two of these (4/29 and 5/6), I will be buying Pizza at Costco after as a reward.
