# Indiana Congressional District 7 :: Indianapolis

District 7 is Indianapolis and this district is handled by the core Indiana 50501 team.  We run regular protests at the State House and are organizing for also doing some good charitable work along the way.

**Note**: We know that District 7 is more than just Indianapolis but we call out a leading city in every district since people can't always relate to their district number.
