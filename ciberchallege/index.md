# The Indiana CiberTruck Challenger

Welcome to the Indiana CiberTruck Challenge.  At our next event, we will have available three d printed models of the CiberTruck:

What we are doing with this is running a contest for:

**The Most Creative Video Featuring This Truck**

Now I'm NOT saying that your video needs to **destroy** the CiberTruck or that you should emulate the venerable **Will It Blend** or that you should emulate **Chain Saw Wielding Elon Musk at CPAC**.  

What we are looking for is creativity that shows Elon Musk what we think of his latest and greatest creation.

At our next event, we will have a box of these 3d printed models and you can turn in your $10 contest entry fee for one.

The prize?  Either a $100 bill or something of greater value (a local business may opt to donate something).

## How Is This Judged?  

Here are the steps:

1. You need to take your video and host it on YouTube or TikTok
2. Make sure you use the hashtag #CiberTruckChallenge 
3. Submit the url via a web form (still being written).  
4. Our panel of 10 judges will review all the videos and make a decision
5. The prize will be awarded in person at our first June event.
