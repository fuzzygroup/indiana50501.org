# Join the 50501 Mailing List 

Here's how to join the mailing list:

1. Send an email to          **Indiana50501-subscribe@lists.riseup.net**             (subject and body email can be blank!)
2. You'll get an email requesting confirmation - simply respond to the confirmation email (reply can be blank, but don't change the subject line!)
3. Once your email is confirmed, youâ€™ll get a welcome email and will be subscribed to the newsletter.

Having troubles? You can always give your email to an Indiana 50501 administrator, and we can add you manually!
